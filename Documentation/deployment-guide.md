## 11. Troubleshooting Guide
### 11.1 Common Issues and Solutions
```markdown
# Troubleshooting Guide

## Connection Issues
### MongoDB Connection Failures
- **Symptom**: Server fails to start with MongoDB connection errors
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check if MongoDB is running: `mongo --host <host> --port <port>`
  2. Verify network connectivity: `ping <mongodb-host>`
  3. Check MongoDB URI format
  4. Verify IP whitelist settings in MongoDB Atlas
  5. Check credentials

### Redis Connection Failures
- **Symptom**: Server starts but Redis features fail
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check if Redis is running: `redis-cli -h <host> -p <port> ping`
  2. Verify network connectivity
  3. Check Redis password
  4. Confirm Redis configuration in .env file

## Performance Issues
### Slow API Responses
- **Symptom**: API requests take longer than 500ms to respond
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check database query performance
  2. Look for missing indexes
  3. Enable query profiling
  4. Verify connection pool settings
  5. Check system resources (CPU, memory)

### Memory Leaks
- **Symptom**: Increasing memory usage over time
- **Solutions**:
  1. Use `--inspect` and Chrome DevTools to profile memory
  2. Check for unclosed connections
  3. Look for unresolved Promises
  4. Verify event listener cleanup

## Authentication Issues
### JWT Token Verification Failures
- **Symptom**: Users report being logged out frequently
- **Solutions**:
  1. Verify JWT_SECRET is consistent across deployments
  2. Check token expiration settings
  3. Verify clock synchronization between servers
  4. Check token format in client requests

## Container Issues
### Container Crashes
- **Symptom**: Container exits shortly after starting
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check container logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
  2. Verify environment variables
  3. Check for port conflicts
  4. Ensure sufficient memory allocation
