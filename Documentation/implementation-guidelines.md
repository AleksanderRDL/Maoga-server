- Place helper functions before their usage
- Export at the end of the file

#### 1.1.4 Function Guidelines

- Use a test database
- Cover happy paths and common error cases
#### 2.2.3 End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Simulate real user interactions
- Test across different environments
- Focus on critical business processes
#### 2.2.4 Test Organization
- Place tests adjacent to implementation files
- Name test files with `.test.js` or `.spec.js` suffixes
- Organize tests with describe/it blocks
- Use descriptive test names (should-style)

### 2.3 Documentation
