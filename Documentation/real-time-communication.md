# Real-time Communication Implementation
This document includes thoughts regarding the real-time communication features of the backend.

## 1. Overview
The platform requires robust real-time communication for several key features:
- Live chat in lobbies
- Matchmaking status updates
- User presence and status tracking
- Notifications for various events
- Lobby state synchronization

Socket.IO will be used as the primary technology for implementing these real-time features, with Redis as a companion for scaling across multiple server instances.

                                | Load Balancer |
                                +---------------+
                                        |
        +-------------+-------------+-------------+
        |             |             |             |
+---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
| API Server 1  | | API Server 2  | | API Server N  |
| Socket.IO     | | Socket.IO     | | Socket.IO     |

        |             |             |
        +-------------+-------------+
                      |
                +------------+
                |   Redis    |
                | Pub/Sub    |
                +------------+
```

### 2.2 Connection Management
Each client will establish a WebSocket connection to the server, which is maintained throughout the user's session. Socket.IO will automatically handle reconnection attempts and fallback to HTTP long-polling when WebSockets are not available.

## 7. Scaling Considerations
### 7.1 Handling Multiple Server Instances
When running multiple server instances, Socket.IO connections need to be properly coordinated. Redis adapter helps with this.

### 7.2 Connection Load Balancing
When using a load balancer, ensure sticky sessions are enabled:
