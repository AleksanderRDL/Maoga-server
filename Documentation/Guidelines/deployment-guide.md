- Install MongoDB Community Edition
- Install Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Clone the repository

### 2.2 Environment Configuration
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   ```

2. Update the environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gamematch
   JWT_SECRET=your_dev_jwt_secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_dev_refresh_secret
   ```

### 2.3 Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start MongoDB (if not running)
# On macOS/Linux
mongod --dbpath=/data/db

# On Windows
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="C:\data\db"
```

### 2.4 Starting the Application
```bash
# Run in development mode with hot reloading
npm run dev

# Alternative: Run using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### 2.5 Docker Compose for Development
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Docker Compose for Development**:
  * **Service Definitions**: Define services for your Node.js application, MongoDB, and potentially Redis (if used for caching/Socket.IO adapter). This ensures all developers have a consistent environment.
  * **Volume Mounting**: Mount your `src` directory into the Node.js container to enable hot-reloading with tools like `nodemon`. This speeds up development as changes are reflected without rebuilding the image.
  * **Environment Variables**: Use an `.env` file (gitignored) referenced in `docker-compose.dev.yml` to manage development-specific configurations (DB connection strings, JWT secrets, API keys for external game DBs).
  * **Database Persistence**: Use Docker volumes for MongoDB data to ensure data persistence across container restarts during development.
  * **Networking**: Define a network for your services to communicate (e.g., Node.js app needs to reach MongoDB).
  * **Simplified Startup**: A single `docker-compose up` command should bring up the entire development stack.
  * **Reproducibility**: Helps new developers get started quickly and ensures everyone is running the same dependency versions (Node, MongoDB, etc.).
  * **Resource Limits**: For complex setups or resource-constrained machines, you might consider defining resource limits for containers, though this is usually more critical for production. (Not important until later)


## 3. Container Images
### 3.1 Development Dockerfile
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Development Dockerfile**:
* **Base Image**: Use an official Node.js image (e.g., `node:18-alpine` or a specific version matching your planned production Node version) for a lightweight and secure base.
* **Working Directory**: Set a `WORKDIR` (e.g., `/usr/src/app`).
* **Dependency Installation**: Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first, then run `npm install`. This leverages Docker's layer caching, so dependencies are only reinstalled if these files change.
* **Application Code**: Copy the rest of the application code.
* **User**: Run the application as a non-root user for better security (e.g., `USER node`). This is good practice even for development.
* **Exposed Port**: Expose the port your application runs on (e.g., `EXPOSE 3000`).
* **Development Command**: Use `nodemon` or a similar tool as the `CMD` to enable hot-reloading. The actual command might be `CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]` if your `package.json` script handles nodemon.
* **Build Arguments**: Consider `ARG` for build-time variables if needed, though less common for dev Dockerfiles.
* **Multi-stage builds**: Likely overkill for a development Dockerfile but crucial for production. (Not important until later)
### 3.2 Production Dockerfile
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Production Dockerfile**:
* **Multi-stage Builds**: This is crucial. Use a `builder` stage with the full Node.js SDK to install dependencies (including `devDependencies` if needed for a build step, e.g., TypeScript compilation, though your project seems to be JavaScript) and then copy only the necessary production code and `node_modules` ( pruned via `npm prune --production` or by installing only `dependencies`) to a lean final image (e.g., `node:18-alpine`). This significantly reduces image size and attack surface.
* **Base Image**: Use a minimal and secure Node.js image (e.g., `node:18-alpine`).
* **Environment Variables**: Do *not* bake secrets into the image. Use `ENV` for non-sensitive defaults, but rely on the runtime environment (e.g., AWS Parameter Store, Kubernetes Secrets) to inject sensitive configurations.
* **User**: Run as a non-root user (`USER node`).
* **Health Check**: Implement a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction to allow Docker/orchestrators to verify application health (e.g., by hitting the `/health` endpoint).
* **Optimized Dependency Installation**: Ensure only production dependencies are installed.
* **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure your application handles `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals for graceful shutdown, especially important in containerized environments.
* **Security Best Practices**: Minimize layers, remove unnecessary files, and scan the image for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or `npm audit`. (Not important until later, but plan for it)
* **Logging**: Ensure application logs are directed to `stdout`/`stderr` so they can be easily collected by container orchestrators.
### 3.3 Building Images
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Building Images**:
* **Tagging**: Use meaningful tags for your images (e.g., `maoga-server:latest`, `maoga-server:1.2.3`, `maoga-server:<git-commit-sha>`). Semantic versioning is good for releases.
* **Build Context**: Be mindful of your `.dockerignore` file to avoid sending unnecessary files to the Docker daemon, speeding up builds and reducing image size. Include `node_modules`, `logs`, `.git`, `coverage`, etc.
* **Caching**: Leverage Docker's build cache by structuring your Dockerfile effectively (e.g., copying `package.json` and installing dependencies before copying application code).
* **Build Arguments (`--build-arg`)**: Use for passing build-time variables if needed (e.g., version numbers, but not secrets).
* **Automated Builds**: Integrate image building into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions). Images should be built automatically on pushes/merges to specific branches.
* **Image Registry**: Push built images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry). For production, a private registry is essential.
* **Security Scanning**: Integrate image security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline after a build. (Not important until later, but plan for it)

## 4. Continuous Integration and Deployment
### 4.1 GitHub Actions Workflow
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding GitHub Actions Workflow**:
* **Triggers**: Define when the workflow should run (e.g., on push to `main`/`develop`, on pull requests targeting these branches).
* **Jobs**:
* **Linting & Formatting**: Run ESLint and Prettier to ensure code quality.
* **Testing**: Execute unit and integration tests. This might involve setting up services like MongoDB in the CI environment (e.g., using `services` in GitHub Actions or Docker Compose).
* **Building**: Build the application and Docker image.
* **Security Scans**: Run `npm audit` and potentially Docker image vulnerability scans. (Not important until later)
* **Deployment (Optional)**: For staging or production, though this might be a separate workflow or triggered manually/on specific conditions.
* **Environment Variables & Secrets**: Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information needed during the CI/CD process (e.g., Docker Hub credentials, AWS credentials for ECR/ECS).
* **Caching**: Cache `node_modules` and Docker layers to speed up workflow runs.
* **Matrix Builds**: If you need to test against multiple Node.js versions or environments, use a build matrix. (Likely not needed initially)
* **Notifications**: Configure notifications for build success/failure (e.g., Slack, email). (Not important until later)
* **Artifacts**: Store build artifacts (e.g., test reports, coverage reports, built image if not pushed directly).


## 5. Cloud Hosting Configurations
### 5.1 AWS Deployment
#### 5.1.1 AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding AWS ECS**:
* **Launch Types**:
* **Fargate**: Serverless compute for containers. Simpler to manage as you don't handle underlying EC2 instances. Good for startups to reduce operational overhead. Might be cost-effective for smaller, spiky workloads.
* **EC2**: You manage a cluster of EC2 instances. More control, potentially more cost-effective for sustained high loads, but more operational overhead.
* **Task Definitions**: Define your application container(s), CPU/memory allocation, Docker image, environment variables (linked to Parameter Store/Secrets Manager), port mappings, logging configuration (CloudWatch Logs), and health checks.
* **Services**: Define how many instances (tasks) of your application should run, load balancing integration (ALB), auto-scaling policies, and deployment strategies (rolling updates, blue/green).
* **Clusters**: A logical grouping of your services and tasks.
* **Load Balancing**: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to your ECS tasks. Configure health checks, SSL/TLS termination.
* **Networking (VPC)**: Deploy ECS tasks within a VPC for security and network control. Configure subnets, security groups (e.g., allow traffic on your app's port from the ALB).
* **IAM Roles**:
* **Task Role**: Grants permissions to your application running in the ECS task (e.g., to access S3, DynamoDB, external game APIs if keys are managed by AWS Secrets Manager).
* **Task Execution Role**: Grants permissions to the ECS agent to pull images from ECR and send logs to CloudWatch.
* **Service Discovery**: For internal communication between services if you expand to microservices later. (Not important until later)
* **Cost**: Monitor costs, especially with Fargate or if auto-scaling is aggressive.
* **Deployment**: Integrate ECS deployments with your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using AWS CLI or CDK in GitHub Actions).
* **Initial Choice**: Fargate is likely a good starting point due to its simplicity, aligning with the "startup" context.
#### 5.1.2 AWS Parameter Store Configuration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding AWS Parameter Store Configuration**:
* **Purpose**: Securely store and manage configuration data and secrets like database credentials, API keys (for external game DB, payment providers), JWT secrets.
* **Hierarchy**: Organize parameters using a hierarchical path (e.g., `/maoga/prod/mongodb_uri`, `/maoga/dev/jwt_secret`). This helps manage different environments and services.
* **Parameter Types**:
* `String`: For plain text configuration.
* `StringList`: For comma-separated lists.
* `SecureString`: For sensitive data, encrypted using AWS KMS. This is crucial for secrets.
* **IAM Permissions**: Grant your ECS Task Role (or EC2 instance profile if using EC2 launch type) permission to read specific parameters from Parameter Store. Follow the principle of least privilege.
* **Integration with ECS**: In your ECS Task Definition, you can specify environment variables that pull their values directly from Parameter Store or Secrets Manager. This avoids hardcoding secrets in the task definition or Docker image.
* **Versioning**: Parameter Store supports versioning, which can be useful for tracking changes and rolling back if needed. (Not important until later for basic use)
* **Cost**: Standard parameters are free. SecureString parameters have a cost associated with KMS. Throughput limits apply.
* **Alternative**: AWS Secrets Manager is another option, often preferred for secrets due to features like automated rotation (though this adds complexity). For your current scale, Parameter Store with `SecureString` is likely sufficient and simpler.
* **Local Development**: Developers will typically use a local `.env` file. Ensure there's a clear process for how these secrets are managed for deployed environments. `.env.example` should list all required variables.

### 5.2 Docker Compose for Staging
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Docker Compose for Staging**:
* **Purpose**: To create a production-like environment for testing before deploying to production. It should mirror the production setup as closely as possible but might be scaled down.
* **When to Use**: While Docker Compose is great for local dev, using it for a *shared* staging environment hosted on a single server can be an intermediate step if you're not yet ready for Kubernetes or ECS. However, it has limitations for scalability, high availability, and management compared to orchestrators.
* **Limitations**:
* **Single Host**: Typically runs on a single VM, so no inherent HA or auto-scaling like ECS/Kubernetes.
* **Manual Management**: Updates, rollbacks, and monitoring are more manual.
* **Networking**: More complex to expose services securely and manage inter-container communication compared to orchestrator-provided networking.
* **Configuration**:
* Use a `docker-compose.staging.yml` file.
* Point to staging database instances (e.g., a separate MongoDB Atlas cluster or a smaller RDS instance).
* Load staging-specific environment variables and secrets (potentially from a `.env.staging` file on the staging server, managed securely).
* Use production-ready Docker images.
* **Recommendation**: If you plan to use ECS or Kubernetes for production, it's often better to have your staging environment also on ECS/Kubernetes (e.g., a separate cluster or namespace). This makes staging a true replica. Using Docker Compose for staging might be a temporary solution if resources or expertise for orchestrators are initially limited.
* **Maoga Context**: Given the "startup" nature and initial local hardware deployment, Docker Compose for staging *could* be a step if you deploy to a single cloud VM for staging first. But aim for ECS/Kubernetes for staging if that's the production goal.

### 5.3 Kubernetes for Production
#### 5.3.1 Kubernetes Deployment
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Kubernetes Deployment**:
* **Complexity**: Kubernetes is powerful but has a steeper learning curve and more operational overhead than ECS Fargate, especially for a small team. Consider if this complexity is justified at the current stage. (Likely not important until much later, if ever for this scale)
* **Managed Kubernetes**: If choosing Kubernetes, use a managed service (EKS on AWS, GKE on Google Cloud, AKS on Azure) to offload master node management.
* **Core Concepts**:
* **Pods**: Smallest deployable units, typically running a single container (your Node.js app).
* **Deployments**: Define the desired state for your application (e.g., number of replicas of your Node.js app Pod). Manages rolling updates and rollbacks.
* **Services**: Provide stable network endpoints (IP address, DNS name) to access your application Pods. (Covered in next section)
* **ConfigMaps & Secrets**: Manage application configuration and secrets. (Covered in later sections)
* **Ingress**: Manage external access to your services, typically HTTP/S. (Covered in a later section)
* **YAML Definitions**: Define all Kubernetes resources using YAML files, which can be version-controlled.
* **Resource Requests/Limits**: Specify CPU and memory requests and limits for your Pods to ensure proper scheduling and resource allocation.
* **Liveness & Readiness Probes**: Configure probes (e.g., hitting the `/health` endpoint) so Kubernetes knows if your application is healthy and ready to receive traffic.
* **Stateful Applications**: MongoDB should ideally be run outside Kubernetes (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) or using a StatefulSet with persistent volumes if self-hosted within Kubernetes (adds significant complexity). Your plan for MongoDB Atlas is good.
* **Redis**: Can be run within Kubernetes (e.g., using a Helm chart) or as a managed service.
* **Maoga Context**: For a startup aiming for easy cloud hosting, ECS Fargate might be a more straightforward initial path to production than Kubernetes. Kubernetes offers more flexibility but demands more expertise.
#### 5.3.2 Kubernetes Service
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Kubernetes Service**:
* **Purpose**: To provide a stable IP address and DNS name to access a set of Pods running your application. Pods are ephemeral and their IPs can change.
* **Types**:
* `ClusterIP`: Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. Default type. Used for internal communication between services.
* `NodePort`: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port. Generally used for development or testing, or as a building block for more advanced ingress solutions.
* `LoadBalancer`: Creates an external load balancer in your cloud provider (e.g., AWS ELB, GCP Cloud Load Balancer) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. This is typically how you expose services to the internet.
* `ExternalName`: Maps a Service to a DNS name, not typically used for this kind of workload.
* **Selector**: A Service uses labels and selectors to identify the set of Pods it routes traffic to. Your Deployment will label the Pods, and the Service will select them.
* **Port Mapping**: Defines how a port on the Service maps to a port on the Pods.
* **Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions)**: If your application requires sticky sessions for Socket.IO (though the Redis adapter should mitigate this), the Service or Ingress controller might need to be configured for it. However, the primary goal with Socket.IO and Redis is to not rely on sticky sessions at the load balancer level.
* **Maoga Context**: If using Kubernetes, you'd likely use a `LoadBalancer` Service type to expose your Maoga server to the internet, or a `ClusterIP` Service if using an Ingress controller.
#### 5.3.3 Kubernetes ConfigMap
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Kubernetes ConfigMap**:
* **Purpose**: To store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. Your application Pods can consume this data as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as files mounted into the container.
* **Use Cases for Maoga**:
* Node.js environment (`NODE_ENV=production`).
* Logging levels.
* External service URLs (if non-sensitive).
* Default pagination limits.
* Feature flag configurations (if simple).
* **Creation**: Can be created from literal values, files, or directories.
* **Consumption by Pods**:
* As environment variables.
* Mounted as a volume, where keys become filenames and values are the file content.
* **Updates**: Updating a ConfigMap doesn't automatically trigger a rolling update of Pods that use it, unless the Pod spec is changed (e.g., by a Deployment) or if the way it's consumed (e.g., as a subPath volume mount) allows for some dynamic updates (though this can be tricky). Usually, a Deployment rollout is needed to pick up ConfigMap changes.
* **Size Limits**: ConfigMaps are not designed for large amounts of data.
* **Separation from Secrets**: Keep sensitive data in Kubernetes Secrets, not ConfigMaps.
* **Maoga Context**: You'll use ConfigMaps for any runtime configurations that aren't secret and might vary between environments (though staging/production differences are often best handled by separate ConfigMap definitions per environment/namespace).
#### 5.3.4 Kubernetes Secrets
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Kubernetes Secrets**:
* **Purpose**: To store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, API keys (external game DB, payment provider), and JWT secrets.
* **Storage**: Secrets are stored in etcd, base64 encoded by default. For stronger protection, etcd encryption at rest should be enabled in your cluster.
* **Consumption by Pods**:
* As environment variables. (Be cautious, as this can expose secrets to `kubectl describe pod` if not careful with RBAC).
* Mounted as a volume, where keys become filenames and values are the file content. This is often the preferred method as it allows applications to read secrets from files.
* **Types**: Kubernetes has built-in types for common secrets (e.g., `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` for image pull secrets), but you'll likely use `Opaque` for custom secrets.
* **Management**:
* Create secrets using `kubectl create secret` or YAML definitions.
* Store YAML definitions securely (e.g., in a private Git repo with access controls, or use tools like HashiCorp Vault, Sealed Secrets, or Bitnami Sealed Secrets for GitOps).
* **Avoid committing plain text secrets to Git.**
* **RBAC**: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can read Secrets in the cluster.
* **Maoga Context**: Essential for storing `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, external API keys. The plan to use cloud provider's secret management (like AWS Parameter Store/Secrets Manager with ECS) is a good alternative if not going deep into Kubernetes immediately. If using Kubernetes, these are the direct equivalent.
#### 5.3.5 Kubernetes Ingress
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Kubernetes Ingress**:
* **Purpose**: Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS. It provides routing rules, SSL/TLS termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
* **How it Works**: An Ingress resource defines routing rules. An Ingress Controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress, Traefik, HAProxy Ingress) is a separate application running in your cluster that implements these rules, usually by configuring a load balancer.
* **Key Features**:
* **Path-based Routing**: Route traffic to different services based on URL path (e.g., `/api/users` to user-service, `/api/games` to game-service – though you have a monolith, this is useful for future microservices or separate admin interfaces).
* **Host-based Routing**: Route traffic based on hostname (e.g., `api.maoga.gg` to your backend, `app.maoga.gg` to a frontend).
* **SSL/TLS Termination**: Handle SSL certificates and terminate HTTPS connections, passing unencrypted traffic to your services within the cluster. Often integrates with `cert-manager` for automatic certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt.
* **Load Balancing**: The Ingress controller typically manages or integrates with an external load balancer.
* **Maoga Context**: If using Kubernetes, an Ingress would be the standard way to expose your Maoga server API. You'd define rules to route traffic to your Maoga server's Service. SSL/TLS termination here is critical. For Socket.IO, ensure the Ingress controller and its underlying load balancer are configured to support WebSockets (e.g., proper timeout settings, upgrade headers). Nginx Ingress, for example, supports this with annotations.


### 5.4 Serverless Deployment (Alternative)
#### 5.4.1 AWS SAM Template
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding AWS SAM Template**:
* **Purpose**: AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications on AWS. It uses YAML or JSON templates to define your serverless resources (Lambda functions, API Gateway APIs, DynamoDB tables, etc.).
* **Relevance to Maoga**: Your current architecture is a Node.js/Express monolith, intended for containerization (ECS/Docker). SAM and Lambda are for serverless functions, which is a different architectural pattern.
* **Could it be used?**: You *could* break down parts of your Maoga backend into Lambda functions exposed via API Gateway (e.g., user registration, fetching game lists). However, this would be a significant shift from the current modular monolith design.
* **Real-time/Socket.IO**: Managing persistent Socket.IO connections with Lambda is more complex and often requires API Gateway WebSocket APIs and potentially other services like DynamoDB for connection management.
* **Long-running processes**: Matchmaking algorithms, if they become long-running, might not fit well with Lambda's execution time limits unless designed as step functions or batch processes.
* **Maoga Context**: **Not directly relevant or recommended given your current documented architecture (modular monolith with Express and Socket.IO aimed at container deployment).** Stick with ECS or a similar container orchestration path. Introducing SAM now would be a major architectural change and add unnecessary complexity unless you explicitly decide to go serverless for specific, new microservices later. (Not important for the current plan)
#### 5.4.2 Lambda Entry Point
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Lambda Entry Point**:
* **Purpose**: If you were using AWS Lambda, each Lambda function would have an entry point (a handler function) that AWS Lambda invokes when the function is triggered (e.g., by an API Gateway request).
* **Example (Node.js)**: `exports.handler = async (event, context) => { ... }`.
* **Maoga Context**: **As with AWS SAM, this is not directly relevant to your current Express-based monolithic architecture.** Your entry point is `server.js` which starts an Express server. If you were to, for instance, refactor a specific API endpoint (e.g., a simple GET request for game news) into a Lambda function, then you'd define an entry point for that specific function. (Not important for the current plan)

## 6. Database Setup and Migration
### 6.1 MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account
2. Create a new cluster (M10 for staging, M20+ for production)
3. Configure network access (whitelist IPs or use VPC peering)
4. Create database users
5. Get connection string

### 6.2 Database Indexes
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Database Indexes**:
* Refer to the `database-models.md` document, specifically section "4. Indexing Strategy", which already outlines Primary Indexes, Compound Indexes, Text Indexes, and TTL Indexes.
* **Key Considerations already listed**:
* Unique identifiers (email, username).
* Foreign keys (userId, gameId).
* Status fields for filtering.
* Timestamps for sorting.
* Compound indexes for relationships and filtered sorting.
* Text indexes for search.
* TTL indexes for ephemeral data like notifications, lobbies, match requests.
* **Additional Considerations for Deployment Guide**:
* **Index Creation Strategy**: Indexes should be defined in Mongoose schemas as planned. Mongoose will attempt to create them when the application starts if they don't exist.
* **Production Indexing**: For large existing collections, creating indexes can lock tables and impact performance. This should be done during a maintenance window or using background index creation features of MongoDB if available and necessary. (Not important initially, but for future scaling)
* **Monitoring Index Usage**: MongoDB Atlas and other monitoring tools can help identify unused or inefficient indexes. Regularly review index performance. (Not important until later)
* **Testing Indexes**: Ensure your tests (especially performance tests) run against a database with realistic data and indexes to verify query performance.
### 6.3 Data Migration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Data Migration**:
* **Purpose**: To manage and apply changes to your database schema or data structure as your application evolves. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and enabling new features.
* **Scenarios for Maoga**:
* Adding new fields to User profiles (e.g., new preference options).
* Changing data types.
* Renaming fields or collections.
* Populating new fields with default or derived data.
* Introducing new collections and relationships.
* **Strategy**:
* **Migration Scripts**: Write individual, versioned migration scripts (e.g., `001-add-user-karma.js`, `002-transform-game-schema.js`). Each script should have an `up` function to apply the migration and a `down` function to revert it (if feasible and necessary).
* **Migration Tool**: Use a migration tool like `migrate-mongo` (as suggested in Sprint 1) or `node-migrate`. These tools help manage the execution of migration scripts, keep track of which migrations have been applied, and allow for rollbacks.
* **Idempotency**: Migration scripts should ideally be idempotent (running them multiple times has the same effect as running them once).
* **Process**:
1.  Generate a new migration script.
2.  Write the `up` (and optionally `down`) logic.
3.  Test the migration locally and in a staging environment.
4.  Run migrations as part of your deployment process *before* the new application code that relies on the changes is deployed.
* **Data Transformation**: For complex data transformations, ensure scripts are performant and consider running them in batches if dealing with large datasets.
* **Zero-Downtime Migrations**: For critical applications, aim for migrations that don't require downtime. This often involves additive changes first, then deploying code that can handle both old and new schemas, then a cleanup migration. (More advanced, not critical for initial MVP)
* **Backup Before Migration**: Always back up your database before running significant migrations in production.
* **Maoga Context**: Sprint 1 already plans for choosing and setting up a migration tool. This is a good foundation.


## 7. Environment Monitoring and Logging
### 7.1 Logging Configuration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Logging Configuration**:
* **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) from the start, as planned in Sprint 1 (using Winston or Pino). This makes logs machine-readable and easier to parse, search, and analyze in log management systems.
* **Log Levels**: Use standard log levels (e.g., `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `verbose`). Configure the log level per environment (e.g., `info` in production, `debug` in development).
* **Key Information in Logs**:
* Timestamp (ISO 8601 format).
* Log level.
* Message.
* Request ID/Trace ID: Crucial for tracing a single request through multiple services or log entries. Implement middleware to add this to all logs for a request.
* User ID (for authenticated requests, where appropriate and not PII sensitive in all contexts).
* Service/Module name.
* Stack traces for errors.
* **Log Output**:
* **Development**: Console output is fine, perhaps pretty-printed for readability.
* **Production/Staging**: Log to `stdout`/`stderr`. Container orchestrators (ECS, Kubernetes) will collect these logs and forward them to a centralized logging system (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, ELK stack, Datadog, Logz.io).
* **Sensitive Information**: Be extremely careful not to log sensitive PII, passwords, API keys, or JWT tokens. Sanitize logs if necessary.
* **Log Rotation/Management**: If logging to files directly (not recommended for containerized prod environments), configure log rotation. For cloud environments, the logging service handles this.
* **Maoga Context**: The plan for structured logging with request tracing from Sprint 1 is excellent. Ensure this is consistently applied across all modules.
### 7.2 Application Monitoring
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Application Monitoring**:
* **Purpose**: To gain insights into the health, performance, and behavior of your application in real-time.
* **Key Metrics to Monitor**:
* **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**:
* Request rates (per endpoint).
* Error rates (per endpoint, overall, HTTP 4xx/5xx).
* Latency/Response times (average, p90, p95, p99 for critical endpoints).
* Transaction traces for slow requests.
* **System Resources (for Node.js process & underlying infrastructure if not serverless)**:
* CPU utilization.
* Memory usage (heap size, event loop lag).
* Active handles/requests.
* Garbage collection behavior.
* **Database Performance (MongoDB Atlas provides this)**:
* Query latency.
* Connection count.
* Index performance.
* Replication lag (if applicable).
* **Socket.IO Specifics**:
* Number of active connections.
* Message rates (incoming/outgoing).
* Event latencies.
* **Matchmaking & Lobby Metrics**:
* Matchmaking queue lengths.
* Average matchmaking time.
* Number of active lobbies.
* Lobby creation/closure rates.
* **External API Integrations (Game DB)**: Latency and error rates for calls to external services.
* **Tools**:
* **Cloud Provider Tools**: AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring.
* **Dedicated APM Solutions**: Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, Sentry (also good for error tracking).
* **Prometheus & Grafana**: Open-source solution for metrics collection and dashboarding. (More setup required)
* **Node.js specific**: `appmetrics` (from IBM), `clinic.js` (for local profiling).
* **Dashboards**: Create dashboards to visualize key metrics for quick health checks and trend analysis.
* **Maoga Context**: Start with what MongoDB Atlas and your cloud provider (e.g., CloudWatch if on AWS) offer. Sprint 1's `/health` endpoint is a basic start. Gradually integrate more detailed APM as the application scales and complexity grows. (Detailed APM is not critical for MVP but plan for it)
### 7.3 Alerting Configuration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Alerting Configuration**:
* **Purpose**: To proactively notify the development/ops team about critical issues, performance degradation, or anomalies before they significantly impact users.
* **What to Alert On (Examples for Maoga)**:
* **High Error Rates**: Sustained increase in HTTP 5xx errors or unhandled exceptions.
* **Increased Latency**: Critical API endpoints (login, matchmaking request, lobby join) exceeding response time thresholds.
* **Resource Exhaustion**: High CPU/memory utilization on servers/containers for a sustained period.
* **Database Issues**: High DB query latency, connection failures, low storage on MongoDB Atlas.
* **Socket.IO Issues**: Significant drop in active connections, high message processing latency.
* **Matchmaking Failures**: Matchmaking queue length exceeding a threshold for too long, low match success rate.
* **External API Failures**: High error rate when calling the external game database.
* **Security Events**: Potential security breaches (e.g., unusual login patterns, though this is more advanced).
* **Certificate Expiry**: Alerts for SSL/TLS certificate expiry.
* **Alerting Tools**:
* Integrated with your monitoring system (CloudWatch Alarms, Datadog Monitors, Grafana Alerts).
* PagerDuty, Opsgenie for incident management and escalation.
* **Alert Thresholds**: Define clear, actionable thresholds. Avoid overly sensitive alerts (alert fatigue) or too loose alerts (missing issues).
* **Notification Channels**: How alerts are delivered (e.g., email, Slack, SMS, PagerDuty).
* **Actionable Alerts**: Alerts should provide enough context for the recipient to understand the issue and start investigating (e.g., link to relevant dashboard, specific error message).
* **Runbooks**: For common alerts, have documented procedures (runbooks) on how to investigate and resolve them.
* **Maoga Context**: Start with basic alerts for application uptime (via `/health` endpoint) and critical error rates. Expand as monitoring capabilities are built out. (Not critical for initial local deployment, but essential for any cloud deployment)

## 8. Backup and Disaster Recovery
### 8.1 MongoDB Backup Strategy
#### 8.1.1 Automated Daily Backups
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Automated Daily Backups**:
* **Importance**: Absolutely critical for data protection against accidental deletion, corruption, or system failures.
* **MongoDB Atlas**: If using MongoDB Atlas (as planned for staging/production), it provides built-in automated continuous backups and point-in-time recovery (PITR). This is the recommended approach.
* **Configuration**: Ensure continuous backup is enabled in Atlas.
* **Retention Policy**: Configure the backup retention period according to your needs and compliance requirements (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
* **If Self-Hosting MongoDB (e.g., for local dev, or if Atlas wasn't used - which it is for prod)**:
* Use `mongodump` for logical backups.
* Schedule `mongodump` using `cron` (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
* Store backups securely, preferably off-site (e.g., S3, another server).
* Encrypt backups.
* Test restore procedures regularly.
* **What to Backup**: Primarily the MongoDB database. Application code is in Git. Configuration should be managed via IaC or versioned files (and secrets via secure stores).
* **Maoga Context**: Rely on MongoDB Atlas's capabilities for staging and production. For local development, direct MongoDB data persistence via Docker volumes is usually sufficient, but developers should be aware that this isn't a true backup. The plan for MongoDB Atlas backup in `deployment-guide.md` is good.

#### 8.1.2 MongoDB Atlas Backup
For production environments, use MongoDB Atlas continuous backups:
1. Navigate to Atlas UI > Clusters > Backup
2. Enable continuous backup
3. Configure backup policy (retention, frequency)
4. Set up point-in-time recovery

### 8.2 Redis Backup Strategy
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Redis Backup Strategy**:
* **Purpose of Redis in Maoga**: The documentation mentions Redis optionally for caching and session management, and potentially for Socket.IO adapter for scaling.
* **If Redis is used for Caching**:
* **Durability**: Cache data is generally transient and can be rebuilt from the source of truth (MongoDB or external APIs). Backing up cache data is often not necessary. If Redis fails, the cache is cold, leading to temporarily higher load on the database, but no data loss.
* **Consideration**: If rebuilding the cache is extremely expensive or slow, you *might* consider Redis persistence (RDB snapshots or AOF logging), but this adds complexity. For most caching use cases, it's simpler to accept cache loss and rebuild.
* **If Redis is used for Session Management (and sessions are critical to retain)**:
* **Persistence**: Enable Redis RDB snapshots (point-in-time) and/or AOF (Append Only File for better durability, logs every write).
* **Backups**: If using RDB, these snapshot files can be backed up to persistent storage (like S3).
* **Managed Redis**: Cloud providers (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, Google Memorystore) offer managed Redis services that often include backup and replication features. This is the recommended approach if Redis data persistence is critical.
* **If Redis is used for Socket.IO Adapter**: The data stored by the adapter is typically transient state about connections and rooms. Backing it up is generally not required; if Redis fails, connections might be disrupted but should re-establish.
* **Maoga Context**:
* **Initial MVP**: If Redis is only for caching game data or similar, backups are likely not needed. The system should be resilient to cache failures.
* **Later Stages**: If Redis is used for critical session data or as a primary store for some feature (unlikely given MongoDB focus), then a managed Redis service with backups would be important. (Not important until Redis usage is critical and persistent)

### Complete System Failure
1. Activate the standby region/environment
2. Update DNS to point to the standby environment
3. Restore database from the latest backup
4. Verify system functionality
5. When the primary environment is ready, sync data back and switch traffic


## 9. Scaling Strategies
### 9.1 Horizontal Scaling
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Horizontal Scaling**:
* **Purpose**: To handle increased load by adding more instances (servers/containers) of your application rather than increasing the resources (CPU/memory) of a single instance (vertical scaling). This is key for high availability and scalability.
* **Maoga Application (Node.js)**: Node.js is single-threaded, so running multiple instances of your Maoga server behind a load balancer is essential to utilize multiple CPU cores and handle more concurrent users.
* **Stateless Application Design**: For effective horizontal scaling, your application instances should be as stateless as possible.
* **Session Management**: If you use sessions, store them in a shared store like Redis or a database, not in-memory of individual Node.js instances. JWTs (planned) are stateless by nature on the server side (token carries state).
* **Socket.IO**: When scaling Socket.IO, you need an adapter (e.g., `socket.io-redis`) to broadcast events across multiple instances. Each instance only knows about its direct connections, so the adapter shares room and event information via Redis Pub/Sub.
* **Load Balancer**: An essential component to distribute incoming traffic across your application instances (e.g., AWS ALB, Nginx). It should also handle health checks to remove unhealthy instances from rotation.
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas is designed for scalability (sharding, replica sets). Your application's ability to scale will also depend on the database's ability to handle increased load.
* **Auto-Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling for your application instances (e.g., in ECS or Kubernetes) based on metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, or request count.
* **Maoga Context**:
* The modular monolith can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the entire application.
* JWT for authentication supports statelessness.
* Socket.IO with Redis adapter is the correct approach for scaling the real-time component.
* This is important as user base grows. (Not critical for initial local deployment, but design for it from Sprint 1 for cloud)
### 9.2 Database Scaling
#### 9.2.1 MongoDB Scaling
For MongoDB Atlas:
1. Upgrade cluster tier (M10 → M20 → M30 → M40)
2. Add more shards for horizontal scaling
3. Configure read preferences to use secondary nodes for read-heavy operations

#### 9.2.2 Redis Scaling
For Redis:
1. Use Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
2. Implement Redis Sentinel for high availability
3. Use Redis Enterprise for managed scaling
### 9.3 Application Optimization
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Application Optimization**:
* **Database Queries**:
* **Efficient Queries**: Use MongoDB's query profiler (`explain()`) to analyze and optimize slow queries.
* **Indexing**: Ensure all frequently queried fields, sort fields, and join keys (lookups) are properly indexed. (Covered in `database-models.md` and Sprint 17)
* **Projections**: Only fetch the data you need from MongoDB using projections to reduce data transfer and processing.
* **Lean Queries**: Use `.lean()` in Mongoose for read-heavy operations that don't require Mongoose's change tracking or virtuals, improving performance.
* **Caching**:
* Implement caching for frequently accessed and rarely changing data (e.g., game details from external API, popular user profiles).
* Use in-memory cache (e.g., `node-cache`) for single-instance scenarios or small datasets, and Redis for distributed caching.
* **Asynchronous Operations**: Leverage Node.js's non-blocking I/O. Use `async/await` effectively. Avoid blocking the event loop.
* **Code Profiling**: Use Node.js profiling tools (e.g., built-in profiler, Chrome DevTools, Clinic.js) to identify CPU bottlenecks in your code.
* **Payload Sizes**: Minimize API request/response payload sizes. Use pagination.
* **Compression**: Enable GZIP or Brotli compression for HTTP responses.
* **Socket.IO Optimization**:
* Send only necessary data over WebSockets.
* Be mindful of event frequency.
* Use Socket.IO rooms efficiently.
* **Memory Management**: Monitor for memory leaks. Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners, timers, and resources.
* **Load Testing**: Regularly perform load tests to identify performance bottlenecks under stress. (Planned for Sprint 17)
* **Maoga Context**: This is an ongoing process. Start with good database practices and indexing. Caching for external game API calls is a good early optimization (Sprint 3). More intensive optimization can occur as performance data becomes available.

## 10. Security Considerations
### 10.1 SSL/TLS Configuration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding SSL/TLS Configuration**:
* **Importance**: Essential for securing data in transit (HTTPS for APIs, WSS for WebSockets). Protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Required for user trust and often for compliance (GDPR).
* **Where to Terminate SSL/TLS**:
* **Load Balancer**: Recommended approach. The load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, Nginx, Cloudflare) handles SSL/TLS termination. Traffic between the load balancer and your application instances within your private network (VPC) can be HTTP, simplifying application configuration.
* **Application Level**: Your Node.js/Express server can directly handle HTTPS. This requires managing certificates on the application servers. Less common for scalable cloud deployments.
* **Certificates**:
* **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Obtain certificates from a trusted CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt - free, DigiCert, Comodo).
* **Automated Certificate Management**:
* **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: If using AWS services (ALB, CloudFront), ACM provides free public certificates and handles automatic renewal.
* **Let's Encrypt with Certbot**: Can be automated if managing your own web server/proxy.
* **Kubernetes `cert-manager`**: Automates certificate management within Kubernetes.
* **Configuration**:
* Ensure your server/load balancer is configured with strong cipher suites and TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3). Disable outdated protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, 1.1).
* Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
* **Socket.IO**: Use `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections. If SSL/TLS is terminated at the load balancer, your Socket.IO server might still listen on `ws://` internally, but the client connects via `wss://`.
* **Maoga Context**: For any cloud deployment (staging/production), SSL/TLS is a must. Using ACM with an AWS ALB is a straightforward approach if deploying on AWS.
### 10.2 Security Headers
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Security Headers**:
* **Purpose**: HTTP response headers that instruct browsers to behave more securely, helping to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS, clickjacking, etc.
* **Key Headers to Implement**:
* `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Tells browsers to only communicate with your server using HTTPS. (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`)
* `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: Controls the resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page. Helps prevent XSS. Can be complex to configure correctly for dynamic applications. Start with a restrictive policy and loosen as needed. (Might be more relevant for a frontend, but good to be aware of for API if it serves any HTML or if there's an admin UI).
* `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type. (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`)
* `X-Frame-Options`: Protects against clickjacking by controlling if your site can be embedded in an `<iframe>`. (e.g., `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`)
* `Referrer-Policy`: Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests. (e.g., `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`)
* `Permissions-Policy` (formerly `Feature-Policy`): Controls which browser features can be used by the page (e.g., microphone, camera, geolocation). (More for frontends)
* **Implementation**:
* Can be set using middleware in Express (e.g., `helmet` library simplifies setting many of these headers).
* Configure at the load balancer or reverse proxy level if preferred.
* **Maoga Context**: Using `helmet` in your Express app is a good and easy way to set sensible defaults for many of these. Important for enhancing security, especially with user-facing aspects or if an admin panel is served.
### 10.3 Rate Limiting
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Rate Limiting**:
* **Purpose**: To protect your API from abuse, brute-force attacks (e.g., on login or password reset endpoints), and to ensure fair usage for all users.
* **Implementation Strategy**:
* **Middleware**: Implement rate limiting as middleware in your Express application.
* **Keying**: Identify requests based on IP address (common, but can be problematic with NAT or proxies), user ID (for authenticated users), or API key.
* **Storage**: Store request counts and timestamps.
* **In-memory**: Simple for single-instance deployments (e.g., `express-rate-limit` can use an in-memory store). Not suitable for distributed environments unless sticky sessions are guaranteed (which you want to avoid for scalability).
* **External Store (Redis)**: Preferred for distributed environments. Redis is fast and good for this kind of counter/expiry workload. Libraries like `rate-limit-redis` can be used with `express-rate-limit`.
* **Types of Limits**:
* **General API limit**: A global limit for all requests from an IP.
* **Endpoint-specific limits**: Stricter limits for sensitive or expensive operations (e.g., login attempts, password reset, new account registration, matchmaking initiation).
* **User-specific limits**: For authenticated users, to prevent a single user from overwhelming the system.
* **Response**: When a limit is exceeded, return an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code. Include headers like `Retry-After` to inform the client when they can try again.
* **Maoga Context**: Crucial for `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/reset-password`, and potentially for matchmaking request submissions. Start with IP-based limiting and consider user-based for authenticated routes as you scale. Using Redis for the store is recommended for cloud deployment. Planned in `implementation-guidelines.md` and `Sprint-Implementation-plan.md` Key Consideration for GDPR/Security.

## 11. Troubleshooting Guide
### 11.1 Common Issues and Solutions
```markdown
# Troubleshooting Guide

## Connection Issues
### MongoDB Connection Failures
- **Symptom**: Server fails to start with MongoDB connection errors
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check if MongoDB is running: `mongo --host <host> --port <port>`
  2. Verify network connectivity: `ping <mongodb-host>`
  3. Check MongoDB URI format
  4. Verify IP whitelist settings in MongoDB Atlas
  5. Check credentials

### Redis Connection Failures
- **Symptom**: Server starts but Redis features fail
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check if Redis is running: `redis-cli -h <host> -p <port> ping`
  2. Verify network connectivity
  3. Check Redis password
  4. Confirm Redis configuration in .env file

## Performance Issues
### Slow API Responses
- **Symptom**: API requests take longer than 500ms to respond
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check database query performance
  2. Look for missing indexes
  3. Enable query profiling
  4. Verify connection pool settings
  5. Check system resources (CPU, memory)

### Memory Leaks
- **Symptom**: Increasing memory usage over time
- **Solutions**:
  1. Use `--inspect` and Chrome DevTools to profile memory
  2. Check for unclosed connections
  3. Look for unresolved Promises
  4. Verify event listener cleanup

## Authentication Issues
### JWT Token Verification Failures
- **Symptom**: Users report being logged out frequently
- **Solutions**:
  1. Verify JWT_SECRET is consistent across deployments
  2. Check token expiration settings
  3. Verify clock synchronization between servers
  4. Check token format in client requests

## Container Issues
### Container Crashes
- **Symptom**: Container exits shortly after starting
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check container logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
  2. Verify environment variables
  3. Check for port conflicts
  4. Ensure sufficient memory allocation
```
### 11.2 Log Collection Script
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Log Collection Script**:
* **Purpose**: If logs are written to files on a server (less common for cloud-native/containerized apps logging to stdout/stderr), a script might be needed to periodically collect, aggregate, and forward these logs to a centralized logging system.
* **Maoga Context (Cloud Deployment)**:
* **ECS/Kubernetes with Cloud Logging**: If deploying to ECS or Kubernetes and your application logs to `stdout`/`stderr` (which is the recommended practice for containerized apps), the orchestrator or cloud provider's logging agent (e.g., CloudWatch Agent, Fluentd, Fluent Bit) will automatically collect these logs and send them to a centralized system (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Elasticsearch). **In this scenario, a custom log collection script on the application server is generally not needed.**
* The focus should be on configuring the logging *within* the application (structured JSON to stdout) and configuring the *cloud environment* to collect these standard output streams.
* **Maoga Context (Initial Local/Single Server Deployment)**:
* If you are running on local hardware or a single VM initially and logging to files, then a simple script (e.g., shell script, Python script) using `cron` could be used to:
* Compress old log files.
* Move them to an archive location.
* Or, use a log shipper like Filebeat to send them to a log management system if you set one up.
* **Recommendation**: For your planned cloud deployment, aim for `stdout`/`stderr` logging and rely on cloud-native log collection. A custom script is likely an unnecessary complication unless you have very specific legacy or non-containerized components. (Likely not important if following container best practices)
