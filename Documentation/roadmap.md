## Implementation Notes & Best Practices

### Development Approach
- Start each sprint with clear architecture decisions documented
- Implement vertical slices of functionality where possible
- Follow TDD approach with unit tests before implementation
- Conduct code reviews for all pull requests
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation as features develop

### Technical Considerations
- Implement robust error handling from the beginning
- Design with observability in mind (logging, metrics)
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout capability
- Plan database indexes early to avoid performance issues
- Build security into each feature, not as an afterthought

### Project Management
- Begin each sprint with planning and end with retrospective
- Maintain a technical debt backlog alongside feature work
- Document architectural decisions for future reference
- Create automated tests for critical user flows
- Plan for regular security audits throughout development

### Scaling Strategy
- Design data models with future sharding in mind
- Implement caching strategy early for read-heavy operations
- Use message queues for background tasks and eventual consistency
- Consider rate limiting strategies for public-facing APIs
- Plan database growth and implement appropriate monitoring
