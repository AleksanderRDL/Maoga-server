## Implementation Plan per Sprint

*(General note for all sprints: All code changes should be covered by relevant tests as per `testing-strategy.md`, and API/database documentation should be updated continuously.)*

### Phase 1: Foundation Building

#### Sprint 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Project & Version Control**:
        * Initialize Git repository with a clear branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
        * Set up Node.js project with `package.json`, defining scripts for dev, test, lint, start.
    * **Development Environment & Standards**:
        * Configure linter (ESLint) and formatter (Prettier) and integrate into pre-commit hooks if possible.
        * Establish the modular monolith project structure (`src`, `src/modules`, `src/config`, `src/middleware`, `src/utils`, `tests`) as per `project-structure.md`.
        * Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for local development (Node.js app, MongoDB instance).
        * Write initial `README.md`, development standards, and setup guide.
    * **Core Server & API**:
        * Implement a basic Express.js server (`src/app.js`, `src/server.js`) with a health check endpoint (`/health`).
    * **Module & Communication Design**:
        * Define core module boundaries and initial inter-module communication patterns (direct service calls, placeholders for future event bus).
    * **Authentication Framework**:
        * Design JWT authentication strategy: token structure, generation, verification, expiry, refresh token mechanism, and secure client-side storage considerations.
    * **Configuration and Secrets Management (Key Consideration 2)**:
        * Set up `.env` file system for local environment variables (`.env.example` committed, `.env` gitignored).
        * Establish a strict policy against committing any secrets. Document how secrets will be handled in staging/production later (placeholder for tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables in CI/CD).
    * **Logging, Monitoring, and Error Handling (Key Consideration 1)**:
        * **Structured Logging**: Implement a logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) for structured JSON logs from the start. Ensure all logs include a timestamp, log level, and message. Implement a request tracer ID for all incoming requests and include it in all related logs.
        * **Basic Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling middleware (as per `implementation-guidelines.md`). Define initial custom error classes (`AppError`, `ValidationError`, etc.).
        * **Initial Monitoring**: Basic health check endpoint. Think about what 1-2 critical metrics could be logged for future monitoring (e.g., error count).
    * **Database Migrations (Key Consideration 3)**:
        * Choose and set up a database migration tool (e.g., `migrate-mongo`) or establish a versioned script-based migration process. Create an initial (empty) migration.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Set up testing frameworks (Mocha, Chai, Sinon). Write initial setup tests and tests for the health check endpoint and basic error handling. Focus on testing error responses.
    * **CI/CD Pipeline**:
        * Configure GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for linting, running tests, and potentially building a Docker image on push/PR to `develop` and `main`.
    * **Data Privacy by Design (Key Consideration 9)**:
        * During initial data model discussions (even if full models come later), start thinking about data minimization for any user-related information.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  CI/CD pipeline successfully completes (linting, placeholder tests pass).
    2.  Local development environment (Dockerized) builds and the application starts correctly.
    3.  `/health` endpoint returns `200 OK` with expected status information.
    4.  Structured logging (e.g., JSON with request ID) is implemented and visible for basic requests.
    5.  Basic error handling middleware correctly formats a known type of error (e.g., 404 for undefined route) into the standard JSON error response.
    6.  Database migration tool can connect to the database and execute an initial (even if empty) migration successfully.
    7.  Project adheres to configured ESLint and Prettier standards.

#### Sprint 2: User Management Foundations

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **User Schema & Model**:
        * Define the `User` schema in MongoDB (`database-models.md`) using Mongoose. Include fields for email, username, hashed password (bcrypt), displayName, roles (`user`, `admin`).
        * **Data Privacy by Design (Key Consideration 9)**: Ensure only necessary personal data is captured. Document the purpose of each piece of PII.
    * **Authentication Service & Controller (`auth` module)**:
        * Registration endpoint (`/api/auth/register`):
            * Input validation (Joi or similar as per `implementation-guidelines.md`).
            * Password hashing using bcrypt.
            * Save user to DB.
            * Generate JWT and refresh token.
        * Login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`):
            * Input validation.
            * Verify credentials, compare hashed password.
            * Generate JWT and refresh token.
        * **Configuration and Secrets Management (Key Consideration 2)**: If sending welcome emails, securely manage email service credentials.
    * **JWT Middleware**:
        * Implement middleware to verify JWT on protected routes, attach `req.user`.
    * **User Service & Controller (`user` module)**:
        * Basic CRUD: Get current user profile (`/api/users/me`); Update current user profile (`/api/users/me` - PATCH, validating updatable fields).
    * **Password Reset Functionality**:
        * Request endpoint (`/api/auth/reset-password`): Generate unique, time-limited token (store securely, e.g., hashed in DB with expiry). (Conceptual email sending for now).
        * Confirmation endpoint (`/api/auth/reset-password/confirm`): Verify token, update password.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**:
        * Log user registration, login, logout, and password reset attempts (excluding sensitive data like passwords). Ensure user IDs are logged for authenticated actions.
    * **Error Handling**: Implement specific error responses for auth failures (invalid credentials, user exists, etc.).
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Unit tests for `AuthService`, `UserService`: registration success/failures (duplicate email/username), login success/failure, password hashing, token generation/validation, profile updates.
        * Integration tests for API endpoints. Test JWT protection.
    * **API Documentation**: Update `api-specs.md` for all new endpoints.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: `AuthService` (password hashing, token generation logic), `UserService` (profile data transformation/validation logic).
    2.  **API/Integration Tests**:
        * Successful user registration with valid data; appropriate error for duplicate email/username; validation errors for invalid input.
        * Successful user login with correct credentials; 401/400 for incorrect credentials.
        * JWT is returned on successful registration/login.
        * Protected user profile endpoint (`/api/users/me`) is accessible with a valid JWT and returns correct user data.
        * Protected user profile endpoint is inaccessible without JWT or with an invalid/expired JWT (returns 401).
        * User can update their own profile (displayName, etc.); validation errors for invalid updates.
        * Password reset request endpoint can be called (mock email sending); password reset confirmation endpoint successfully changes password with a valid token and fails with an invalid one.
    3.  All API endpoints return responses in the standard success/error JSON format.
    4.  Passwords are confirmed to be stored hashed (bcrypt) in the database.

#### Sprint 3: Game Data Integration

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Game Schema & Model**:
        * Define `Game` schema (`database-models.md`) with fields like name, slug, description, coverImage, genres, platforms, releaseDate, external IDs.
    * **Game Service & Controller (`game` module)**:
        * Develop integration with an external game API (IGDB/RAWG).
        * **Configuration and Secrets Management (Key Consideration 2)**: Securely store external API keys.
        * Implement game search/filtering API endpoints: List games (`/api/games`) with pagination, filtering; Get game details (`/api/games/{gameId}`).
    * **Background Job for Data Sync (Key Consideration 6)**:
        * Implement a background job (e.g., using `node-cron` for simplicity initially, or consider BullMQ if Redis is planned soon) for periodic game data updates from the external API.
        * **Error Handling**: Robustly handle failures from the external API during sync (retries, circuit breaker pattern consideration).
        * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Log start/end of sync jobs, number of games updated/added, any errors during sync. Monitor the health and performance of this job.
    * **Caching Layer**:
        * Implement a caching layer (in-memory with `node-cache` or Redis if available) for game data to reduce DB load and external API calls. Cache popular games or recently accessed game details.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Unit tests for `GameService`, mocking external API calls. Test caching logic. Test background job logic (can it be triggered and run a cycle?).
    * **API Documentation**: Update `api-specs.md`.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: `GameService` (fetching, searching, filtering logic; interaction with mocked external game API; caching logic verification - hit, miss, set, invalidate).
    2.  **API/Integration Tests**:
        * `/api/games` endpoint returns a list of games with correct pagination and filtering (by platform, genre, search query).
        * `/api/games/{gameId}` endpoint returns detailed information for a specific game.
    3.  **Background Job Test**: The game data sync job can be manually triggered (or its core logic tested as a unit), successfully fetches data (from a mock external API), and correctly updates/inserts game data into the database. Logs indicate job success/failure and records processed.
    4.  Caching for game data is functional: subsequent identical requests for game data are served faster and potentially without hitting the DB/external API (verify via logs or specific test setup).
    5.  Secure storage and usage of external API keys.

#### Sprint 4: Profile Enhancement & Admin Foundations

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **User Profile Enhancement**:
        * Extend `User` schema: `gamingPreferences` (preferredGames, gameWeights, competitiveness, etc.), `gameProfiles` (inGameName, rank per game).
        * Implement APIs in `UserController` to update these new sections (`/api/users/me/preferences`, `/api/users/me/game-profiles`).
        * **Data Privacy by Design (Key Consideration 9)**: Consider which of these new profile fields should have visibility settings.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
        * Implement RBAC middleware. Check `req.user.role` for admin-only routes.
    * **Admin Module & Initial Tools (Key Consideration 8)**:
        * Create `admin` module with `AdminController` and `AdminService`.
        * Admin User Management:
            * API to list users (`/api/admin/users`) with basic filtering (e.g., by email, username) and pagination.
            * API to view a specific user's full details (admin only).
            * API to update a user's status (e.g., activate, suspend, ban account).
            * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: All admin actions must be securely logged with admin user ID, target user ID, action taken, and timestamp (audit trail).
    * **User Reporting System (Backend Foundation)**:
        * Define `Report` schema: reporterId, reportedId, reason, reportType (e.g., 'user\_profile', 'chat\_message'), status ('open', 'under\_review', 'resolved'), adminNotes.
        * API for users to submit reports.
        * Admin APIs to list reports, view report details, and update report status.
        * **Admin/Support Tools (Key Consideration 8)**: Ensure these admin APIs provide enough information for an admin to understand and act on a report.
    * **Friend System (Basic Data Models)**:
        * Define `Friendship` schema (`database-models.md`) with user1Id, user2Id, status ('pending', 'accepted', 'blocked', 'declined').
        * Implement backend logic for sending a friend request (creates a 'pending' friendship). Full workflow in Sprint 10.
    * **Security (Key Consideration - Implicit)**: Ensure admin endpoints are rigorously protected by RBAC and all inputs are validated.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Unit/integration tests for new profile features.
        * Thorough tests for admin functionalities, especially RBAC protection and audit logging of admin actions. Test user reporting submission and admin report management APIs.
    * **API Documentation**: Update for all new user and admin endpoints.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: Logic for updating extended user profiles; RBAC checking logic.
    2.  **API/Integration Tests (User Profile)**:
        * Users can successfully update their gaming preferences and game profiles via respective API endpoints.
        * Input validation for preference and game profile data.
    3.  **API/Integration Tests (Admin)**:
        * Admin APIs (`/api/admin/users` for list/view, `/api/admin/users/{userId}/status` for status update) are accessible only by users with 'admin' role (RBAC enforced - 403 for non-admins, 401 for unauthenticated).
        * Admin users can successfully list users, view user details, and change a user's account status.
        * Users can submit a report via the API.
        * Admins can list/view submitted reports.
    4.  **Friendship**: Users can send a friend request; a 'pending' friendship record is created.
    5.  Audit logs for admin actions (e.g., changing user status) are created correctly.

### Phase 2: Core Matchmaking System

#### Sprint 5: Matchmaking Algorithm Foundation

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Data Models**:
        * Define `MatchRequest` schema: userId, status, criteria (games with weights, gameMode, groupSize, region/language/skill preferences), preselectedUsers, timestamps.
        * Define `PlayerSkill/Rank` data structures (likely within `User.gameProfiles`).
    * **Matchmaking Service & Controller (`matchmaking` module)**:
        * APIs for users to submit (`/api/matchmaking` POST) and cancel (`/api/matchmaking/{requestId}` DELETE) matchmaking requests.
        * **Idempotency (Key Consideration 4)**: Consider if submitting a matchmaking request needs to be idempotent (e.g., if a user quickly retries, don't create two identical active requests).
    * **Matching Algorithm (`MatchAlgorithmService`) - Initial Version**:
        * Focus on core criteria: game selection (primary game), game mode, region.
        * Simple skill matching if `gameProfiles.rank` is available.
        * Implement `calculateCompatibilityScore` (basic version) from `matchmaking-algorithm.md`.
    * **Queue Management**:
        * Implement an in-memory matchmaking queue (or Redis lists if prepared). Structure queues based on game, mode, region as per `matchmaking-algorithm.md`.
    * **Match History**:
        * Define `MatchHistory` schema. Implement basic tracking when a match is formed by the algorithm (even if lobbies aren't created yet).
    * **Algorithm Validation Framework**:
        * Develop scripts or a simple framework to feed sample `MatchRequest` data to the algorithm and observe outputs.
        * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Test with various scenarios: no users, few users, many users, specific preference clashes.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**:
        * Log new match requests, cancellations.
        * Log algorithm processing cycles: number of requests processed, criteria used, potential matches found (or why none were found).
        * Log matchmaking queue lengths periodically.
    * **Error Handling**: For matchmaking request submissions and algorithm processing.
    * **API Documentation**: Update for new matchmaking endpoints.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: Core logic of `MatchAlgorithmService` (e.g., compatibility scoring for various criteria combinations, basic match formation given a small set of requests). Test queue management (add/remove/peek requests).
    2.  **API/Integration Tests**:
        * Users can submit a matchmaking request (`/api/matchmaking`) with valid criteria; request is stored correctly with 'searching' status.
        * Users can cancel their active matchmaking request (`/api/matchmaking/{requestId}`); request status is updated to 'cancelled'.
        * Invalid matchmaking criteria are rejected with appropriate validation errors.
    3.  **Algorithm Simulation**: Using the validation framework with sample data:
        * Verify that users with highly compatible primary criteria (game, mode, region) are matched.
        * If skill data is available, verify it's being considered at a basic level.
        * A `MatchHistory` record is created (can be basic at this stage) when the algorithm forms a match.
    4.  Logging for new match requests, cancellations, and basic algorithm processing steps is present.


#### Sprint 6: Real-time Communication

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Socket.IO Integration**:
        * Integrate Socket.IO into the Express server, managed by `SocketManager` (as per `real-time-communication.md`).
        * Implement JWT-based authentication for Socket.IO connections.
    * **Connection Management & User Presence**:
        * Track active sockets per user (`userSockets` Map: userId -\> Set\<socketId\>). Handle multiple connections from the same user.
        * On connect: Mark user 'online', join user-specific room (e.g., `user:${userId}`).
        * On disconnect: Update user status if no other active connections.
        * Emit `user:status` events to relevant clients (e.g., friends, if friend system is more developed) when status changes.
    * **Real-time Matchmaking Updates**:
        * Client event `matchmaking:subscribe` { requestId }. Server joins socket to `match:${requestId}` room.
        * Server emits `matchmaking:status` events (status, searchTime, potentialMatches, estimatedTime) to the `match:${requestId}` room or user-specific room.
    * **Event Emission System & Protocol**:
        * Formalize event names and payload structures in `real-time-communication.md`.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**:
        * Log socket connection/authentication success/failure, disconnections.
        * Log key events emitted and received (with sanitized data).
        * Monitor active Socket.IO connection count.
    * **Error Handling**: For socket authentication, event handling, and emissions. What happens if an event fails to send?
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Develop/use utilities (`socket.io-client` in tests) for WebSocket functionality. Test connection, auth, event emission/reception for matchmaking status. Test presence updates.
    * **Configuration**: Make Socket.IO settings (e.g., ping timeouts, CORS origins) configurable.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery (using `socket.io-client` in tests)**:
    1.  **Connection & Auth**: Client successfully connects to Socket.IO with a valid JWT; connection is rejected with an invalid/missing JWT.
    2.  **User Presence**:
        * When a client connects, their status is updated to 'online' (verify internally, e.g., in `userSockets` map or DB).
        * If implemented, `user:status` events are emitted to relevant clients (e.g., simulate another client subscribed to this user's presence).
        * When a client disconnects (and it's their last connection), their status is updated to 'offline'.
    3.  **Matchmaking Status Updates**:
        * Client can emit `matchmaking:subscribe` with a `requestId`.
        * Server correctly joins the client's socket to the appropriate room for that request.
        * When matchmaking logic (can be mocked for this test) processes a request, the server emits `matchmaking:status` events to the subscribed client with correct payload (status, searchTime, etc.).
    4.  Socket.IO event handlers deal with malformed payloads gracefully.
    5.  Logging for socket connections, disconnections, and key events is implemented.

#### Sprint 7: Lobby System

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Data Models**:
        * Define `Lobby` schema: name, status (forming, ready, active, closed), game details, members (userId, status, isHost, readyStatus), capacity, chat settings, autoMessage, timestamps.
        * Define `Chat` schema for lobby chat: chatType ('lobby'), participants, lobbyId, messages array (or separate Message collection).
    * **Lobby Service & Controller (`lobby` module)**:
        * `MatchmakingService` calls `LobbyService.createLobby()` upon finding a match.
        * **Idempotency (Key Consideration 4)**: Ensure lobby creation from a match event is idempotent.
        * Implement lobby state machine (forming -\> ready -\> active -\> closed) logic within `LobbyService`.
    * **Member Management**:
        * APIs for joining (`/api/lobbies/{lobbyId}/join` - may be automatic post-match) and leaving (`/api/lobbies/{lobbyId}/leave`).
        * Socket.IO events for real-time updates: `lobby:update`, `lobby:member:joined`, `lobby:member:left`, `lobby:member:ready`.
        * "Ready" functionality: API (`/api/lobbies/{lobbyId}/ready`) and socket event (`lobby:member:ready`). `LobbyService` checks if all members are ready to transition lobby state.
    * **Lobby Chat (Basic Backend)**:
        * `ChatService` integration: create a chat room when a lobby is created.
        * Socket.IO events for sending/receiving lobby chat messages (`chat:message`, `chat:typing` as per `real-time-communication.md`). Store messages.
    * **Automated Lobby Messages**: Implement system for predefined lobby messages.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**:
        * Log lobby creation, member joins/leaves, status changes, chat messages (sanitized).
        * Audit trail of important lobby events (e.g., host changes, kicks).
    * **Error Handling**: For lobby creation, member management, state transitions.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Unit/integration tests for lobby lifecycle, member actions, chat functionality.
        * Test concurrent operations (multiple users interacting with the same lobby).
    * **API & WebSocket Documentation**: Update relevant documents.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: `LobbyService` state machine logic (forming -> ready -> active -> closed transitions based on events/conditions); member management logic (add, remove, update status).
    2.  **Integration/API Tests**:
        * Successful lobby creation when matchmaking (mocked) finds a match; lobby is created with correct initial state, game details, and initial members.
        * Users (lobby members) can set their ready status via API (`/api/lobbies/{lobbyId}/ready`).
        * Users can leave a lobby via API (`/api/lobbies/{lobbyId}/leave`).
    3.  **Socket.IO Tests**:
        * Clients receive `lobby:update` events when lobby state/settings change.
        * Clients receive `lobby:member:joined`, `lobby:member:left`, `lobby:member:ready` events when respective actions occur.
        * Basic lobby chat: messages sent via `chat:message` socket event are received by other connected lobby members; messages are persisted in the `Chat` document or `Messages` collection.
    4.  Test "all members ready" condition correctly transitions lobby state (e.g., to 'ready').
    5.  Idempotency test for lobby creation from a match event (if a duplicate event arrives, a second lobby is not created for the same match).

#### Sprint 8: Notification System

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Data Models**:
        * Define `Notification` schema: userId, type, title, message, data (for deep linking), status (unread/read), deliveryChannels, deliveryStatus.
    * **Notification Service & Controller (`notification` module)**:
        * `NotificationService.createNotification()`: Core logic to create and dispatch notifications.
        * APIs for users: get notifications (`/api/notifications`), mark as read/all read, get count.
    * **Configurable Preferences**:
        * Extend `User` schema for `notificationSettings` (email, push, inApp for various event types).
        * API to update these settings (`/api/users/me/notifications/settings`). `NotificationService` must check these preferences.
    * **Delivery Channels**:
        * **In-app**: `NotificationService` uses `SocketManager` to send `notification:new` and `notification:count` events to the specific user's socket.
        * **Push Notifications (Firebase/FCM)**:
            * API to register/unregister device tokens (`/api/users/me/devices`), store in `User.deviceTokens`.
            * `NotificationService` integrates with FCM SDK to send pushes.
            * **Background Jobs (Key Consideration 6)**: Sending push notifications should be offloaded to a job queue to handle batching, retries, and API rate limits of the push provider.
            * **Configuration and Secrets Management (Key Consideration 2)**: Securely store FCM server key.
        * **Email Notifications (Basic)**:
            * Integrate an email service (Nodemailer + SMTP provider or transactional email API like SendGrid).
            * `NotificationService` to send emails.
            * **Background Jobs (Key Consideration 6)**: Email sending should also be a background job.
            * **Consideration**: Email deliverability (SPF, DKIM records in DNS) and bounce handling.
    * **Notification Triggers**:
        * Integrate `NotificationService.createNotification()` calls in relevant services:
            * `MatchmakingService`: Match found.
            * `FriendService`: Friend request received/accepted.
            * `LobbyService`: Lobby full/ready, invited to lobby.
            * `ChatService` (optional): New unread messages.
    * **Delivery Tracking**: Update `deliveryStatus` in `Notification` model.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Log notification creation, targeted delivery channels, and delivery success/failure for each channel.
    * **Error Handling**: For failures in sending notifications via any channel.
    * **Privacy by Design (Key Consideration 9)**: Ensure notification content is appropriate and preferences are strictly adhered to.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Mock external push/email services. Test notification creation, preference checks, and in-app delivery via sockets.
    * **API & WebSocket Documentation**: Update.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: `NotificationService` logic for checking user preferences before sending; dispatch logic for different channels (mocking external services like FCM/email).
    2.  **API/Integration Tests**:
        * Users can retrieve their notifications (`/api/notifications`) with pagination and filtering by status.
        * Users can mark notifications as read (single and all) (`/api/notifications/{notificationId}`, `/api/notifications/read-all`).
        * Users can get their unread notification count (`/api/notifications/count`).
        * Users can update their notification preferences (`/api/users/me/notifications/settings`).
    3.  **In-App Notification Test (Socket.IO)**: When a notification is created (e.g., by a mocked "match found" event) and the user has in-app notifications enabled, they receive a `notification:new` socket event with the notification payload, and a `notification:count` update.
    4.  **Push/Email Channel Tests (Mocked Senders)**:
        * Verify `NotificationService` *attempts* to send a push notification (calls mocked FCM service) if the user has push enabled and a device token.
        * Verify `NotificationService` *attempts* to send an email (calls mocked email service) if the user has email notifications enabled.
    5.  **Trigger Tests**: When a key event occurs (e.g., mock a friend request being created), a corresponding `Notification` document is created in the database for the target user.
    6.  Background jobs for sending push/email notifications are triggered and process items from a queue (mocking the actual sending).
    7.  `Notification.deliveryStatus` is updated correctly after attempting delivery.

### Phase 3: Feature Enrichment

#### Sprint 9: Advanced Matchmaking Features

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Algorithm Enhancements (`MatchAlgorithmService`)**:
        * **Multi-game matching**: Modify algorithm to consider `MatchRequest.criteria.games` (array with weights). `calculateGameMatchScore` needs to use these weights.
        * **Tiered matching (fallbacks)**: Formalize and implement criteria relaxation strategy (`relaxCriteria` function in `MatchmakingService`). `MatchRequest` needs `relaxationLevel` and `relaxationTimestamp`. Periodically check and relax criteria for long-waiting requests.
        * **Region/Language matching**: Implement `calculateRegionMatchScore` and `calculateLanguageMatchScore` thoroughly, using `User.preferences` and `MatchRequest.criteria`.
    * **Planned Matchmaking**:
        * Handle `MatchRequest.criteria.scheduledTime`. `MatchmakingService` needs a separate queue/logic for these, triggering matching closer to `scheduledTime`.
    * **Pre-made Group Matchmaking**:
        * Utilize `MatchRequest.preselectedUsers`. Algorithm must try to keep these groups intact. Implement `groupPreselectedUsers` logic.
        * API to add friends to an active matchmaking request (`/api/matchmaking/{requestId}/friends`).
    * **Performance Testing & Optimization**:
        * Develop more complex test data for the matchmaking algorithm.
        * Profile the matchmaking process under simulated load. Optimize database queries and algorithmic complexity.
        * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Log detailed metrics about matchmaking rounds: number of users processed, average compatibility scores, time taken, relaxation levels reached.
    * **Idempotency (Key Consideration 4)**: Review "add friends to matchmaking" and other update operations for idempotency.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Create specific test cases for multi-game, tiered matching, scheduled matching, and group matchmaking scenarios.
    * **API Documentation**: Update any changes to matchmaking request/response.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Algorithm Validation (Expanded Scenarios)**:
        * **Multi-game**: Users selecting multiple games with different weights are matched based on shared high-priority games or a combination reflecting weights.
        * **Tiered Matching/Relaxation**: Long-waiting requests show evidence of criteria relaxation (e.g., by inspecting request state or logs) and eventually find matches they wouldn't have with initial strict criteria.
        * **Region/Language**: Matches correctly prioritize users with "strict" overlapping preferences, then "preferred," then "any."
        * **Planned Matchmaking**: Requests with `scheduledTime` are processed at/near the scheduled time and not immediately.
        * **Pre-made Group**: Groups submitting a request are kept together, and the system finds the remaining players to fill the lobby.
    2.  **API Tests**: `/api/matchmaking/{requestId}/friends` endpoint successfully adds friends to an ongoing matchmaking request.
    3.  Performance of the advanced algorithm with more complex data sets is within acceptable limits for this stage.
    4.  Logging shows details of criteria relaxation and weighted considerations.

#### Sprint 10: Social Features Enhancement

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Full Friend Workflow (`FriendService`, `FriendController`)**:
        * Implement APIs: send request (`/api/friends/requests` POST), list pending requests (`/api/friends/requests` GET), accept/reject (`/api/friends/requests/{requestId}` PATCH), remove friend (`/api/friends/{friendId}` DELETE).
        * Update `Friendship` status ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected', 'blocked').
        * Trigger notifications for friend requests and acceptances using `NotificationService`.
        * **Idempotency (Key Consideration 4)**: Sending a friend request or blocking a user should ideally be idempotent.
    * **Friend List Management**: API to get user's friends (`/api/friends` GET, filter by status).
    * **Blocking/Reporting Functionality**:
        * API to block a user (`/api/friends/block` POST) -\> updates `Friendship` to 'blocked'.
        * API to unblock (`/api/friends/block/{userId}` DELETE).
        * API to get blocked users (`/api/friends/blocked` GET).
        * Blocked users should not appear in matchmaking results for each other, nor be ableable to send messages/friend requests.
    * **Direct Messaging (1-on-1 Chat) (`ChatService`, `ChatController`)**:
        * Enable creation of 'direct' type chats (e.g., on friendship acceptance or explicitly).
        * API to get/create direct chat with a user (`/api/chat/direct/{userId}`).
        * API to list all user's chats (`/api/chat` GET, including direct and lobby chats).
        * Socket.IO events for direct messages.
    * **User Activity Tracking (`UserActivityService`)**:
        * Define `UserActivity` schema (userId, activityType, details, timestamp).
        * Implement `UserActivityService.logActivity()` called from various services (e.g., `FriendService.addFriend`, `MatchmakingService.joinMatch`).
        * **Data Privacy by Design (Key Consideration 9)**: Ensure activity tracking is disclosed and, if necessary, configurable by the user.
    * **Karma Point System**:
        * Add `karmaPoints` to `User` schema.
        * API for users to give karma post-match/interaction (e.g., `/api/karma/{matchId_or_interactionId}` POST { targetUserId, rating: +/-1 }).
        * `KarmaService` to handle karma updates and prevent abuse (e.g., limit karma per interaction).
    * **Admin/Support Tools (Key Consideration 8)**:
        * Admins may need to review/mediate reported interactions or karma abuse. Consider if any specific admin APIs are needed here.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Test all friend operations, blocking logic (ensure blocked users can't interact), DM functionality, activity logging, and karma updates.
    * **API & WebSocket Documentation**: Update.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **API/Integration Tests (Friends)**:
        * User A can send a friend request to User B; User B sees it in their pending requests.
        * User B can accept/reject User A's request; `Friendship` status updates; notifications are sent.
        * User A and User B can see each other in their respective friend lists (status 'accepted').
        * User A can remove User B as a friend; relationship is severed.
    2.  **API/Integration Tests (Blocking)**:
        * User A can block User B; User B cannot send friend requests/DMs to User A; User A and B are not matched together.
        * User A can unblock User B.
        * User A can retrieve their list of blocked users.
    3.  **API/Integration Tests (Direct Messaging)**:
        * Friends can initiate/retrieve a direct chat session.
        * Messages sent via API/Socket.IO in a DM are received by the other participant and persisted.
    4.  **User Activity Logging**: Key social actions (friend added, user blocked, DM sent - metadata only) are correctly logged in `UserActivity`.
    5.  **Karma System**: Users can submit karma for an interaction; target user's karma points are updated; basic abuse prevention (e.g., one karma submission per interaction) is in place.
    6.  Test that appropriate notifications are triggered for friend requests/acceptances.

#### Sprint 11: Rich Media & Content

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Media Upload System**:
        * API endpoint for profile image upload (`/api/users/me/image` POST).
        * API endpoint for chat media upload (`/api/chat/{chatId}/media` POST). Use `multer` for multipart/form-data.
        * **Security**: Rigorous file type validation (allowlist specific MIME types), size limits. Consider malware scanning if possible (might be a 3rd party service).
    * **Media Storage Integration (e.g., AWS S3)**:
        * Integrate SDK for chosen cloud storage.
        * `StorageService` to handle uploads, deletions. Store URLs/keys in `User.profileImage` or `Message.mediaUrl`.
        * **Configuration and Secrets Management (Key Consideration 2)**: Securely store cloud storage credentials.
    * **Media Processing Pipeline (Basic) (Key Consideration 6 - Background Job)**:
        * For image uploads (avatars), use a library like `sharp` for server-side resizing to standard dimensions and basic optimization (compression). This should be done asynchronously (background job/lambda) after upload to not block the request.
    * **Emoji and GIF Support in Chat**:
        * Backend: Ensure `Message.content` can store UTF-8 emojis. `Message.contentType` to support 'emoji', 'gif' (storing URL for GIFs).
        * Frontend handles selection; backend stores and relays.
    * **(Optional) File Sharing**: Defer unless a strong requirement emerges. Focus on chat images/short videos.
    * **Content Moderation Hooks**:
        * When media is uploaded, publish an event (e.g., `media.uploaded` { mediaUrl, userId, context: 'chat/profile' }) that a separate moderation service (or admin tool) can subscribe to.
        * Update media records with a moderation status (pending, approved, rejected). Only show approved media.
        * **Admin/Support Tools (Key Consideration 8)**: Admins need a way to review media flagged by hooks or reports, and approve/reject/delete it.
    * **CDN Integration**: Configure cloud storage to serve files via a CDN. Ensure generated URLs point to CDN.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Log media uploads (success/failure, file types, sizes), processing job status.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Test file uploads (valid/invalid types, sizes), storage integration (mocked), basic processing. Test moderation hooks (event emission).
    * **API Documentation**: Update.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **API/Integration Tests (Uploads)**:
        * Users can successfully upload valid profile images; `User.profileImage` is updated with the correct URL (from storage/CDN).
        * Users can successfully upload valid media files (images) to chat; `Message.mediaUrl` is populated; `Message.contentType` is 'image'.
        * Uploads of invalid file types or oversized files are rejected with appropriate errors.
    2.  **Storage Integration**: Verify that uploaded files are correctly stored in the configured cloud storage (mocked if in CI, but testable in dev/staging).
    3.  **Background Job Tests (Media Processing)**: The image resizing job processes newly uploaded images, creating resized versions (verify by checking stored files or mock outputs).
    4.  **Chat**: Messages containing emojis (UTF-8) and valid GIF URLs are stored and can be retrieved correctly.
    5.  **Content Moderation Hooks**: An event (e.g., `media.uploaded`) is emitted when new media is successfully uploaded, containing relevant metadata for a moderation system to pick up.
    6.  (If CDN configured) Verify that URLs served for media point to the CDN.

#### Sprint 12: Analytics & Insights Foundation

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Event Tracking Infrastructure**:
        * Solidify `UserActivity` logging or introduce a dedicated `AnalyticsEvent` collection.
        * Define a clear schema for events: eventName, userId (anonymized if needed for certain analytics), timestamp, properties (event-specific data).
        * Ensure services are consistently emitting these events for key actions (user registered, match created/joined/completed, game played, feature used).
    * **Analytics Data Models (Aggregations)**:
        * Design schemas for pre-aggregated data (e.g., Daily Active Users - DAU, Monthly Active Users - MAU, popular games, matchmaking success rates, average wait times).
        * Implement background jobs (Key Consideration 6) to calculate and store these aggregates periodically (e.g., nightly).
    * **Basic Dashboard Data APIs (Admin-Only)**:
        * Create secure admin APIs (`/api/admin/stats/...`) to fetch these aggregated metrics for an internal dashboard.
        * Examples: user growth, matchmaking stats, popular game modes.
    * **User Engagement Metrics**: Define and track: session duration (approximated from `lastActive`), feature usage counts (matchmaking requests, DMs sent, profile updates).
    * **Matchmaking Effectiveness Tracking**: Log and aggregate: avg wait times, match completion rates, distribution of relaxation levels reached before matching.
    * **Performance Monitoring Hooks**: Integrate with APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools if available, or ensure logs are detailed enough for performance analysis of specific business transactions.
    * **Logging Enhancement for Business Metrics**: Ensure logs are structured for easy parsing by analytics tools or scripts.
    * **Data Privacy by Design (Key Consideration 9)**:
        * Ensure all analytics data collection is compliant with privacy policies.
        * Anonymize or pseudonymize data used for general platform statistics where individual user identification is not necessary.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Test event emission, background aggregation jobs (with sample data), and accuracy of admin stat APIs.
    * **API Documentation**: Document admin stats APIs.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Event Tracking**: Key business events (user registered, match created, game played) are correctly emitted by services and stored (e.g., in `AnalyticsEvent` collection).
    2.  **Aggregation Job Tests**: Background jobs that calculate daily/weekly aggregates (e.g., DAU, popular games) run correctly and produce accurate data based on sample input events.
    3.  **Admin Dashboard API Tests**: Admin-only APIs (`/api/admin/stats/...`) for fetching key metrics return correct aggregated data and are properly secured by RBAC.
    4.  Verify that metrics for user engagement (e.g., session duration approximation) and matchmaking effectiveness (e.g., avg wait times) are being collected or can be derived from stored events/logs.
    5.  If anonymization/pseudonymization is implemented for public stats, verify it's working.

### Phase 4: Monetization & Advanced Features

#### Sprint 13: Shop System Foundation

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Data Models**:
        * `ShopItem` schema: type, name, description, imageUrl, price {amount, currency ('virtual')}, rarity, availability.
        * `UserInventory` schema: userId, items [{ itemId, acquiredAt, isEquipped, equipLocation }].
        * Add `virtualCurrencyBalance` to `User` schema.
    * **Shop Module (`shop` module with `ShopService`, `ShopController`, `InventoryService`, `InventoryController`)**:
        * APIs for Browse/filtering shop items (`/api/shop/items`, `/api/shop/items/{itemId}`).
        * API to get user's inventory (`/api/shop/inventory`).
    * **Virtual Currency Purchase Workflow**:
        * API to purchase an item using virtual currency (`/api/shop/purchase` POST { itemId }).
        * `ShopService` to:
            * Verify item existence and availability.
            * Check user's `virtualCurrencyBalance`.
            * Deduct currency.
            * Add item to `UserInventory`.
            * **Idempotency (Key Consideration 4)**: Ensure purchasing an item is idempotent. If the request is retried, the user isn't charged twice or given duplicate items.
    * **Item Application to Profiles**:
        * APIs to equip/unequip items (`/api/shop/inventory/equip`, `/api/shop/inventory/unequip`).
        * `InventoryService` updates `UserInventory`. `UserService` or `ProfileService` logic to reflect equipped items on user profile (e.g., `User.profileDecorationId`).
    * **Admin/Support Tools (Key Consideration 8)**:
        * Backend APIs/tools for admins to:
            * CRUD shop items.
            * View/manage user virtual currency balances (e.g., for support refunds or grants).
            * View/manage user inventories.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Log all shop transactions, inventory changes, virtual currency balance updates (audit trail).
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Test item creation, listing, purchase (sufficient/insufficient funds), inventory updates, equipping/unequipping.
    * **API Documentation**: Update.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **API/Integration Tests (Shop & Inventory)**:
        * Users can browse/filter shop items.
        * Users can view their inventory.
        * Users can purchase items using virtual currency:
            * Succeeds if balance is sufficient; virtual currency is deducted; item is added to inventory.
            * Fails if balance is insufficient.
        * Users can equip/unequip items from their inventory; `UserInventory` and relevant user profile fields (e.g., `profileDecorationId`) are updated.
    2.  **Admin APIs**: Admins can CRUD shop items; admins can view/adjust user virtual currency and inventories (for support).
    3.  **Idempotency**: Purchasing an item with virtual currency is idempotent.
    4.  Audit logs for all shop transactions, inventory changes, and virtual currency balance adjustments are created.

#### Sprint 14: Payment Integration

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Payment Provider Selection & Integration**:
        * Choose provider (Stripe, etc.). Integrate their SDK.
        * **Configuration and Secrets Management (Key Consideration 2)**: Securely store API keys (publishable and secret keys).
    * **Payment Workflow (Real Money)**:
        * e.g., For buying virtual currency packs or premium items.
        * API endpoint to create payment intent (`/api/shop/payment` POST { itemId/currencyPackId }). Backend communicates with provider, returns client secret/ID to frontend.
        * Frontend uses client secret to complete payment with provider.
    * **Webhook Handling**:
        * Secure webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/payment-provider`) to receive payment success/failure/dispute notifications from provider.
        * **Idempotency (Key Consideration 4)**: Process webhooks idempotently (e.g., check event ID to prevent duplicates).
        * Verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity.
    * **Data Models**:
        * `Transaction` schema: userId, itemId/packId, amount, currency ('real'), paymentProviderTransactionId, status (pending, completed, failed, refunded), timestamps.
    * **Fulfillment**: Upon successful payment confirmation (via webhook), update user's virtual currency or grant item to inventory.
    * **Transaction History & Receipts**: API for users to view their real-money transaction history. (Conceptual receipts, actual email receipts often handled by provider).
    * **Subscription Models (if applicable)**: More complex. Involves managing recurring payments, subscription statuses, grace periods, dunning. Might be a separate, later sprint.
    * **Security (Key Consideration - CRITICAL)**:
        * Adhere to PCI DSS compliance standards (mostly handled by provider if using their hosted fields/elements, but your integration must be secure).
        * Never store raw credit card details.
        * Protect against fraud (provider often has tools).
    * **Refund Process (Backend)**:
        * Admin-initiated refunds. Backend API to trigger refund via payment provider API. Update `Transaction` status.
        * **Admin/Support Tools (Key Consideration 8)**: Admin interface to view transactions and manage refunds.
    * **Legal/Compliance**: Understand tax implications, consumer rights for digital purchases in target regions.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Detailed, secure audit trail for all payment intents, transactions, webhook events, and fulfillment actions.
    * **Error Handling**: Robust handling for payment failures, communication errors with provider, webhook processing errors.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Requires careful setup. Use provider's test modes and mock card numbers. Test full lifecycle: intent creation, payment, webhook confirmation, fulfillment, refunds. Test failure scenarios.
    * **API Documentation**: Update.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery (Using Payment Provider's Test Mode)**:
    1.  **API/Integration Tests**:
        * User can initiate a purchase for a real-money item/virtual currency pack; backend successfully creates a payment intent with the provider and returns a client secret/ID.
        * **Webhook Handling**:
            * Simulate successful payment webhook from provider: webhook signature is validated; transaction status is updated to 'completed'; user entitlement (virtual currency/item) is granted. This process must be idempotent.
            * Simulate failed payment webhook: transaction status is updated to 'failed'.
            * Simulate dispute/refund webhook: transaction status is updated.
        * Users can view their real-money transaction history.
    2.  **Security**: Webhook endpoint is secure and validates incoming requests (e.g., signature check). No sensitive cardholder data is logged or stored by the application.
    3.  **Admin APIs**: Admins can view transaction details. Admin-initiated refund process (backend interaction with payment provider API) updates transaction status correctly.
    4.  Full end-to-end payment flow (initiation, mock payment completion, webhook processing, fulfillment) works correctly in the test environment.
    5.  Critical payment operations are logged for auditing.

#### Sprint 15: Dashboard & Exploration Features

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Activity Feed (`FeedService`, `FeedController`)**:
        * Design `FeedItem` schema (userId (for whom the feed item is generated), actorId (who performed action), type, relevant\_data\_object {type, id, summary}, timestamp).
        * `FeedService` to generate feed items based on `UserActivity` (e.g., friend achieves new rank, friend adds new game, friend joins popular lobby).
        * Fan-out approach for friend activities: when a user performs an action, generate feed items for their friends.
        * API (`/api/feed`) for users to retrieve their personalized feed with pagination.
    * **Game News/Updates Integration**:
        * Reuse external game API (Sprint 3) or find news-specific APIs (e.g., Steam News API).
        * Background job (Key Consideration 6) to fetch and cache news for games users play/follow.
        * API for users to get relevant game news.
    * **Platform Statistics (User-Facing)**:
        * Leverage aggregated analytics from Sprint 12.
        * APIs to show interesting, anonymized platform stats (e.g., most played games this week on platform, trending lobbies).
    * **Personalized Recommendations (Basic)**:
        * "Games your friends play that you don't."
        * "Users with similar game preferences."
        * Requires querying user profiles, friend lists, game data.
    * **Content Discovery APIs**: Endpoints to find popular/trending games, public lobbies, maybe user-generated content if that's a feature.
    * **Performance & Caching**:
        * Feeds and dashboard data can be read-heavy. Implement aggressive caching (e.g., Redis) for generated feeds and popular stats.
        * Optimize database queries for feed generation and recommendations.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Monitor performance of feed generation and API response times for dashboard endpoints.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**: Test feed generation logic, recommendation accuracy (for basic rules), API performance.
    * **API Documentation**: Update.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **API/Integration Tests**:
        * Personalized activity feed API (`/api/feed`) returns relevant, paginated items for a user based on their and their friends' activities.
        * Game news API returns current news for specified/followed games.
        * Platform statistics APIs return accurate and potentially cached public data.
        * Basic personalized recommendations API returns sensible suggestions based on defined rules (e.g., "games your friends play").
    2.  **Performance**: APIs for feeds and dashboards respond within acceptable time limits, especially with caching enabled.
    3.  Test that feed generation logic correctly sources data from `UserActivity` and other relevant events.

#### Sprint 16: Advanced Security & Compliance

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **GDPR & Data Privacy (Key Consideration 9)**:
        * **Data Mapping**: Review all PII stored, its purpose, legal basis for processing, and retention period.
        * **Right to Access**: API and admin tool for users/admins to export all user data in a common format (JSON).
        * **Right to Erasure**: API and admin tool for users/admins to request/perform account deletion. This needs careful implementation:
            * What happens to their content? Anonymize? Delete?
            * Handle references from other users (e.g., DMs, lobby memberships).
            * Ensure data is removed from backups after retention or anonymized.
            * Log deletion requests and confirmations.
        * **Consent Management**: If consent is a basis for processing any data, implement mechanisms to record and withdraw consent.
    * **Advanced Rate Limiting**:
        * Review current rate limits. Implement more granular limits for sensitive operations (e.g., login attempts, password resets, report submissions).
        * Use a persistent store like Redis for distributed rate limiting.
    * **Security Audit and Fixes**:
        * Conduct internal code review focused on security.
        * Use tools like `npm audit --recursive`, Snyk, or ESLint security plugins. Address identified vulnerabilities.
    * **Privacy Policy Enforcement**: Ensure backend logic aligns with the stated privacy policy.
    * **Enhanced Data Encryption**:
        * Verify MongoDB encryption at rest is active.
        * Consider application-level encryption for specific, highly sensitive fields if deemed necessary (adds complexity).
    * **Penetration Testing Preparations**: Prepare documentation and environment for a future external penetration test.
    * **Compliance Documentation**: Maintain internal documentation of data flows, PII locations, security measures, and GDPR compliance efforts (data processing inventory/records of processing activities - ROPA).
    * **Admin/Support Tools (Key Consideration 8)**: The data export and deletion functionalities are critical admin tools. Ensure they are robust, auditable, and tested.
    * **Logging (Key Consideration 1)**: Log all data access requests, export actions, and deletion actions for audit purposes.
    * **Testing (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Thoroughly test data export (is it complete and correct?) and deletion (is data actually removed/anonymized everywhere?). Simulate data subject requests.
        * Test advanced rate-limiting.
    * **API Documentation**: Document any user-facing APIs for data rights.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **GDPR Functionality Tests**:
        * **Data Access/Export**: Users (via API or admin tool) can successfully request and receive an export of their personal data in a common, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON). Exported data must be complete and accurate.
        * **Data Erasure**: Users (via API or admin tool) can successfully request account/data deletion. Verify that their PII is verifiably removed or properly anonymized from all relevant database collections and systems according to the defined data retention policy. Test impact on associated data (e.g., chat messages from a deleted user should be anonymized).
    2.  **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Stricter rate limits on sensitive operations (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, password reset requests from same IP) are correctly enforced.
    3.  Verify that any vulnerabilities identified during internal audits or by security scanning tools have been addressed and re-tested.
    4.  Test that privacy policy enforcement mechanisms (e.g., consent withdrawal if applicable) function correctly.
    5.  Audit logs for all data access requests, export actions, and deletion actions are comprehensive and accurate.

### Phase 5: Optimization & Scaling Preparation

#### Sprint 17: Performance Optimization

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Database Query Optimization**:
        * Use MongoDB `explain()` on slow queries identified by APM or logging.
        * Refine queries, ensure optimal index usage.
    * **Index Strategy Refinement**:
        * Review all indexes. Add missing ones, remove unused/redundant ones. Analyze compound index effectiveness.
    * **Caching Layer Enhancement**:
        * Profile cache hit/miss ratios. Adjust TTLs.
        * Ensure proper cache invalidation strategies for frequently updated data.
        * Consider different caching strategies for different types of data (e.g., write-through, read-through, write-back).
    * **Background Job Optimization (Key Consideration 6)**:
        * Profile resource usage and execution time of background jobs. Optimize logic, batch processing.
    * **API Response Time Improvements**:
        * Profile critical API endpoints. Identify and optimize bottlenecks (CPU-bound operations, I/O waits).
        * Consider asynchronous processing for parts of requests if it improves perceived performance.
    * **Resource Usage Analysis**: Monitor CPU, memory, network, disk I/O under load. Identify and address leaks or excessive consumption.
    * **Load Testing and Bottleneck Identification (Key Consideration 7)**:
        * Use tools (Artillery, k6, JMeter) to simulate realistic concurrent user loads on critical flows (registration, login, matchmaking, lobby interactions, chat).
        * Identify system bottlenecks (application code, database, network, external services).
        * Iteratively optimize and re-test.
    * **Logging/Monitoring (Key Consideration 1)**: Use monitoring data to identify areas needing optimization. Log before/after states for optimization changes to measure impact.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **Load Tests**: Critical APIs and user flows meet defined performance targets (e.g., average response time < X ms, p95/p99 response times, error rate < Y%) under simulated peak load (Z concurrent users).
    2.  **Verification of Optimizations**: Post-optimization, specific slow queries or bottlenecks identified earlier now show measurable improvement under targeted tests or renewed load tests.
    3.  System resource usage (CPU, memory, DB connections) remains stable and within acceptable limits during sustained load tests.
    4.  Cache hit rates for frequently accessed data are demonstrably improved where caching optimizations were applied.

#### Sprint 18: Cloud Deployment Preparation

* **Technical Steps & Considerations**:
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
        * Write/refine IaC scripts (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) for provisioning all cloud resources (servers, DBs, load balancers, cache, networking, IAM roles).
    * **Environment Configuration for Staging/Production (Key Consideration 2)**:
        * Finalize and test secure configuration and secret management for staging and production environments (e.g., AWS Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets, Vault).
    * **Containerization Refinement**:
        * Optimize production `Dockerfile` (multi-stage builds, minimal base images, non-root user, security hardening).
        * Push images to a private container registry.
    * **Cloud Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting (Key Consideration 1)**:
        * Integrate with cloud provider's logging (CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging).
        * Set up monitoring dashboards (CloudWatch Dashboards, Grafana) for key application and infrastructure metrics.
        * **Implement and test comprehensive alerting** for production issues: high error rates, resource exhaustion, service downtime, long queue lengths, slow dependencies. Define alert thresholds and notification channels.
    * **Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy**:
        * Configure automated database backups (e.g., MongoDB Atlas automated backups, or test custom scripts).
        * Define, document, and *test* the disaster recovery plan. This includes:
            * **Restore drills**: Practice restoring the database from a backup into a staging/test environment.
            * Process for redeploying the application to a different region if necessary.
            * Data replication strategy if RPO is very low.
    * **Deployment Automation (CI/CD Enhancement)**:
        * Automate deployments to staging and production using CI/CD pipeline. Implement strategies like blue/green or canary deployments if feasible.
        * Include automated rollback procedures.
    * **Operations Documentation (Runbooks)**: Create initial runbooks for common operational tasks: checking logs, restarting services, handling common alerts, deploying updates.
    * **Final Security Review for Production Setup**: Check network security groups, firewall rules, IAM permissions in the cloud environment.
* **Key Tests to Pass for Delivery**:
    1.  **IaC Deployment Test**: IaC scripts successfully provision a complete staging environment that mirrors the production setup.
    2.  **Configuration Test**: Deployed application in staging loads the correct environment-specific configurations and secrets without any manual intervention post-deployment.
    3.  **Logging/Monitoring/Alerting Test (in Staging)**:
        * Application logs from the staging environment are successfully shipped to and viewable in the centralized logging system.
        * Key metrics from the staging application populate monitoring dashboards.
        * Manually trigger test alerts (e.g., simulate a high error rate, stop a critical dependency like DB temporarily if safe in staging); verify alerts are generated and routed to the correct channels/personnel.
    4.  **Backup and Restore Drill (CRITICAL)**:
        * Successfully perform a full backup of the staging database (or a clone of production DB if feasible).
        * Successfully restore this backup to a separate, clean database instance.
        * Verify data integrity and application functionality against the restored database.
    5.  **Automated Deployment Test**: CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys the latest stable build to the staging environment using the automated deployment strategy (e.g., blue/green, rolling update). Verify zero-downtime if applicable. Test automated rollback if implemented.
    6.  Key operational procedures from the runbook (e.g., checking service status, viewing specific logs) are tested and validated in the staging environment.
