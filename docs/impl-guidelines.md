## 3. Error Handling
### 3.1 Error Classification
#### 3.1.1 Operational Errors
- Expected errors that occur during normal operation
- Examples: validation errors, authentication failures, not found
- Should be handled gracefully and return appropriate responses

#### 3.1.2 Programming Errors
- Bugs or unexpected errors
- Examples: undefined references, type errors
- Should be caught, logged, and fixed

#### 3.1.3 External Errors
- Errors from external services
- Examples: database errors, API failures
- Should be handled with retries or fallbacks where possible

### 3.2 Error Handling Strategy
#### 3.2.1 Custom Error Classes
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Custom Error Classes**:
* **Purpose**: Create a hierarchy of error classes (e.g., extending `Error`) to represent specific types of operational errors in your application. This allows for more granular error handling and standardized error responses.
* **Benefits**:
* **Clarity**: `throw new NotFoundError('User not found')` is more expressive than `throw new Error('User not found')`.
* **Structured Error Handling**: Allows `catch` blocks or error middleware to differentiate error types using `instanceof` and respond appropriately (e.g., set specific HTTP status codes).
* **Standardized Information**: Custom errors can enforce inclusion of properties like `statusCode`, `errorCode` (a unique string for the error type), and `isOperational` (to distinguish programmer errors from operational ones).
* **Examples for Maoga**:
* `BadRequestError` (400)
* `AuthenticationError` (401)
* `AuthorizationError` (403)
* `NotFoundError` (404)
* `ConflictError` (409) (e.g., username already exists)
* `ValidationError` (422) (for input validation failures)
* `InternalServerError` (500) (for unexpected server errors)
* **Implementation**:
```javascript
class AppError extends Error {
constructor(message, statusCode, errorCode, isOperational = true) {
super(message);
this.statusCode = statusCode;
this.errorCode = errorCode;
this.isOperational = isOperational;
Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
}
}

        class NotFoundError extends AppError {
          constructor(message = 'Resource not found', errorCode = 'NOT_FOUND') {
            super(message, 404, errorCode);
          }
        }
   ```
    * **Usage**: `throw new NotFoundError('Game profile not found');`
    * **Maoga Context**: Sprint 1 plan includes defining initial custom error classes (`AppError`, `ValidationError`). This is a fundamental good practice.
#### 3.2.2 Error Middleware
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Error Middleware**:
* **Purpose**: A centralized piece of Express middleware to catch all errors passed to `next(err)` or thrown in route handlers (if using an `asyncHandler` wrapper) and format them into a consistent HTTP response.
* **Placement**: Defined *after* all your routes in `app.js`. It has a signature of `(err, req, res, next)`.
* **Functionality**:
* Determine the HTTP status code (e.g., from `err.statusCode` if it's a custom `AppError`, otherwise default to 500).
* Log the error, especially for 500-level errors (include stack trace for programmer errors).
* Format a consistent JSON error response (as defined in `api-specs.md`).
* Distinguish between operational errors (expected, user-facing messages) and programmer errors (generic message for user, detailed log for developers).
* **Example Structure**:
```javascript
// In your error middleware
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
logger.error(err.message, { stack: err.stack, details: err.details, errorCode: err.errorCode }); // Or more sophisticated logging

          const statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
          const response = {
            status: "error",
            error: {
              code: err.errorCode || (statusCode === 500 ? 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR' : 'UNKNOWN_ERROR'),
              message: err.isOperational && err.message ? err.message : 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'
            }
          };
          if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && !err.isOperational) {
            response.error.stack = err.stack; // Optionally include stack in dev
          }
          if (err.details) { // For validation errors etc.
            response.error.details = err.details;
          }
          res.status(statusCode).json(response);
        }
   ```
    * **Maoga Context**: Essential for robust API behavior. Sprint 1 plans for centralized error handling middleware.
#### 3.2.3 Async Handler Wrapper
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Async Handler Wrapper**:
* **Purpose**: Express doesn't automatically catch errors thrown in `async` route handlers. You'd normally need to `try...catch` every async handler and call `next(err)`. An async handler wrapper is a higher-order function that automates this.
* **How it Works**: It takes an async function (your route handler) and returns a new function that, when executed, calls the original function and chains a `.catch(next)` to its promise.
* **Example**:
```javascript
// utils/asyncHandler.js
const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) => {
Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);
};
module.exports = asyncHandler;

        // routes/userRoutes.js
        const userController = require('../controllers/userController');
        const asyncHandler = require('../../utils/asyncHandler');
        router.get('/me', authMiddleware, asyncHandler(userController.getMe));
   ```
    * **Benefits**:
        * Cleaner controller code (no repetitive `try...catch`).
        * Ensures all promise rejections in async route handlers are passed to the centralized error middleware.
    * **Maoga Context**: A very useful utility for cleaner and safer async route handling. It's a common pattern in Express applications.

### 3.3 Validation Strategy
#### 3.3.1 Request Validation
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Request Validation**:
* **Purpose**: To ensure that incoming request data (body, query parameters, URL parameters) conforms to expected schemas before it hits your business logic. This is crucial for security (preventing injection, type errors) and data integrity.
* **What to Validate**:
* Data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
* Required fields.
* String patterns (regex for emails, slugs).
* Numeric ranges (min/max values).
* Enum values (e.g., for `competitiveness` or `status` fields).
* Array contents and size.
* **Tools**:
* **Joi**: A popular and powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript. (Mentioned as an option in Sprint 2 for user registration)
* **Yup**: Similar to Joi.
* **express-validator**: Middleware-based validation for Express.
* **Implementation**:
* Define validation schemas for each API endpoint's input.
* Use middleware to validate requests against these schemas.
* If validation fails, respond with a `400 Bad Request` or `422 Unprocessable Entity` status and a structured error message detailing the validation errors (e.g., which fields are invalid and why).
* **Example with Joi (Conceptual)**:
```javascript
// userValidation.js
const Joi = require('joi');
const registerSchema = Joi.object({
email: Joi.string().email().required(),
username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
password: Joi.string().min(8).required()
});

        // validationMiddleware.js
        const validateRequest = (schema) => (req, res, next) => {
          const { error } = schema.validate(req.body); // Or req.query, req.params
          if (error) {
            const errors = error.details.map(d => ({ field: d.path.join('.'), message: d.message }));
            return res.status(400).json({ status: 'error', error: { code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', message: 'Invalid input', details: errors }});
          }
          next();
        };
        // router.post('/register', validateRequest(registerSchema), authController.register);
   ```
    * **Maoga Context**: Essential for all endpoints that accept input. The plan to use Joi or similar from Sprint 2 is good.
#### 3.3.2 MongoDB Schema Validation
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding MongoDB Schema Validation**:
* **Purpose**: To enforce data structure, type, and constraints at the database level. This acts as a second line of defense after request validation and helps maintain data integrity even if data is inserted/updated through other means (e.g., scripts, direct DB access).
* **Mongoose Schemas**: Mongoose provides schema definition capabilities where you define types, required fields, default values, enums, min/max, regex, custom validators, etc.
* `type: String, required: true, enum: ['casual', 'ranked']`
* `matchStartTime: { type: Date, default: Date.now }`
* `karmaPoints: { type: Number, min: 0, default: 0 }`
* **Benefits**:
* Ensures data consistency within MongoDB.
* Prevents malformed data from being saved.
* Mongoose validation errors are returned as standard JavaScript errors that can be caught and handled.
* **Limitations**: Mongoose validation runs at the application layer *before* data is sent to MongoDB. MongoDB itself also supports JSON Schema validation rules directly on collections, which can be more robust as they are enforced by the database server itself.
* **Recommendation**: Primarily rely on Mongoose schema validation as it's well-integrated with your application. For most use cases, this is sufficient. MongoDB native validation can be considered for very strict data integrity requirements or if data might bypass the Mongoose layer. (MongoDB native validation is not important until much later, if ever)
* **Maoga Context**: This is already implicitly part of using Mongoose. The key is to define comprehensive and accurate Mongoose schemas for all your collections (User, Game, Lobby, etc.) as per `database-models.md`.

## 4. Security Practices
### 4.1 Authentication Security
#### 4.1.1 Password Handling
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement proper password reset flows
- Never store plain text passwords

#### 4.1.2 JWT Security
- Use short expiration times
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Include only necessary payload data
- Use strong, secure keys

#### 4.1.3 Rate Limiting
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Rate Limiting**:
* **Covered in `deployment-guide.md` (Section 10.3)**. Key points for implementation guidelines:
* **Why**: Prevents abuse (brute force on login/password reset), DoS attacks, and ensures fair API usage.
* **How**: Use middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit` with a store like `rate-limit-redis` for distributed environments).
* **Strategy**:
* Identify requests by IP, or by `userId` for authenticated users.
* Store counts in Redis for scalability.
* Apply stricter limits to sensitive endpoints (auth, registration, matchmaking initiation).
* Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header.
* **Configuration**: Make limits configurable (e.g., via environment variables).
* **Maoga Context**: Essential for public-facing endpoints, especially auth. Sprint 16 (Advanced Security) specifically calls out advanced rate limiting. Basic rate limiting should be considered earlier for sensitive endpoints.

### 4.2 Data Protection
#### 4.2.1 Input Sanitization
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Input Sanitization**:
* **Purpose**: To clean or reject malicious input that could lead to injection attacks (NoSQL injection, XSS if data is reflected to HTML, command injection - less common for Node.js web apps but possible).
* **Mongoose for NoSQL Injection**: Mongoose, by design, helps prevent NoSQL injection because it enforces schemas. Queries built using Mongoose methods typically convert inputs to their defined types, and malicious operators (like `$where` with JavaScript functions) are not used unless explicitly coded.
* **Action**: Continue using Mongoose correctly and avoid constructing queries from raw, unsanitized user input strings.
* **XSS Prevention (Context Matters)**:
* **API Context**: Since this is a backend API serving JSON, the primary concern for XSS is if this JSON data is later rendered *unsanitized* by a frontend client. The API itself should output clean JSON.
* **Sanitizing for Storage (if reflected later)**: If user-supplied strings (e.g., user bio, chat messages) are stored and might be rendered as HTML later by any client, consider sanitizing them *before storage* or ensuring clients *always* sanitize them before rendering.
* **Tools**: Libraries like `dompurify` (if running in a context with DOM, or use a server-side equivalent like `xss-filters` or just ensure proper output encoding on the client). A simpler approach for an API is to ensure data is treated as data, not HTML.
* **General Data Cleaning**: Trim whitespace, convert case if necessary for consistency (e.g., emails to lowercase).
* **Validation as Primary Defense**: Strong input validation (as per 3.3.1) is the first and most important line of defense. If input doesn't match the expected format/type, reject it.
* **Maoga Context**:
* Rely on Mongoose's schema enforcement.
* For user-generated content like bios or chat messages, ensure that if this content is ever rendered as HTML by a frontend, the frontend is responsible for proper escaping/sanitization. The backend API should store the raw (but validated type-wise) input.
* Input validation is key (Sprint 2 user registration validation).
#### 4.2.2 XSS Prevention
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding XSS Prevention**:
* **API Focus**: For a JSON API backend, the main responsibility is to *not* introduce XSS vulnerabilities if any part of your API *could* serve HTML or if your data is consumed by a frontend that might insecurely render it.
* **Key Principles for API**:
* **Output Encoding**: If your API were to ever return HTML content directly (unlikely for a pure JSON API), ensure proper contextual output encoding.
* **Content-Type**: Always set the `Content-Type` header correctly (e.g., `application/json`). This helps prevent browsers from misinterpreting JSON as HTML. Express does this by default with `res.json()`.
* **Data is Data**: Treat user input as data. Store it as data. Send it as JSON data. The client consuming the API is responsible for safely rendering this data (e.g., by using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`, or by using frontend template engines that auto-escape).
* **Avoid Reflecting Unsanitized Input in Error Messages (if HTML)**: If error messages could potentially reflect user input and are rendered as HTML (again, unlikely for JSON API), ensure this is safe.
* **User-Generated Content**: For fields like user bios, chat messages:
* The API should store the content as provided (after basic validation for type, length etc.).
* The responsibility for preventing XSS when *displaying* this content lies with the frontend. The frontend should use appropriate techniques (e.g., sanitizing HTML, using safe templating libraries).
* **Security Headers**: `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) can provide an additional layer of defense, primarily configured and enforced by the frontend application.
* **Maoga Context**: Your backend is primarily a JSON API. The main concern is providing clean data. The frontends (mobile/web) will be responsible for secure rendering. For chat, which includes text, emojis, GIFs, and pictures, ensure the frontend renders these safely.
#### 4.2.3 CORS Configuration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding CORS Configuration**:
* **Purpose**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the page. You need to configure CORS on your Maoga server to allow your frontend applications (mobile app, web app) to access the API if they are served from different origins (domains/ports).
* **Implementation in Express**: Use the `cors` middleware package.
* **Configuration Options**:
* `origin`:
* Specify allowed origins (e.g., `https://app.maoga.gg`, `http://localhost:8080` for local web dev).
* Can be a string, array of strings, regex, or a function for dynamic origin checking.
* Using `*` (allow all origins) is generally discouraged for production APIs unless it's a truly public API. For your app with specific frontends, list them explicitly.
* `methods`: Allowed HTTP methods (e.g., `GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS`).
* `allowedHeaders`: Headers the client can send (e.g., `Content-Type, Authorization`).
* `exposedHeaders`: Headers the client can access in the response (e.g., custom headers like `X-RateLimit-Remaining`).
* `credentials`: Set to `true` if you need to allow cookies or authorization headers with requests from the frontend. If `true`, `origin` cannot be `*`.
* `preflightContinue`: Set to `false` (default) so OPTIONS requests are handled by the CORS middleware and not passed to your routes.
* **Preflight Requests (`OPTIONS`)**: Browsers send an OPTIONS request before "complex" requests (e.g., those with custom headers like `Authorization`, or methods other than GET/HEAD/POST) to check if the actual request is allowed. Your CORS configuration must handle these.
* **Maoga Context**: This will be necessary as your frontend (web app) will likely be served from a different origin than your backend API. Mobile apps often don't have the same CORS restrictions as web browsers, but it's good practice to have a clear CORS policy. Configure this early when you start integrating frontend with backend.


### 4.3 Authorization Implementation
#### 4.3.1 Role-Based Access Control
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
* **Purpose**: To restrict access to certain API endpoints or functionalities based on the role(s) assigned to the authenticated user. Your `DevDocument.md` specifies "Standard user" and "Admin user roles".
* **Implementation**:
1.  **Role Definition**: Define roles in your system (e.g., `user`, `admin`). Store the user's role in their JWT token (for quick checks) and/or in their user document in MongoDB.
2.  **Middleware**: Create RBAC middleware that checks `req.user.role` (populated by your authentication middleware from the JWT).
3.  **Route Protection**: Apply this middleware to specific routes or routers.
* **Example RBAC Middleware**:
```javascript
const authorize = (allowedRoles) => (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.user || !req.user.role) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden: No role assigned' });
  }
  const hasRole = allowedRoles.some(role => req.user.role.includes(role));
  if (!hasRole) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden: Insufficient permissions' });
  }
  next();
};
// Usage: router.get('/admin/users', authMiddleware, authorize(['admin']), adminController.listUsers);
```
* **Admin Functionality**: Specifically protect admin endpoints (view users, ban user, manage reported content, CRUD shop items, manage virtual currency) using RBAC.
* **Granularity**: Initially, `user` and `admin` roles might be enough. As the system grows, you might consider more granular permissions if needed, but this adds complexity.
* **Maoga Context**: This is a core security requirement identified in Sprint 4. The JWT should include the user's role to enable this.
#### 4.3.2 Resource Ownership Check
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Resource Ownership Check**:
* **Purpose**: To ensure that users can only access or modify resources they own or have explicit permission for, even if they are authenticated and have a general role that allows the *type* of action. This is distinct from RBAC.
* **Examples for Maoga**:
* A user should only be able to update their *own* profile (`/api/users/me`), not another user's profile via `/api/users/{otherUserId}` (unless they are an admin).
* A user can only cancel *their own* matchmaking request.
* A user can only leave a lobby *they are a member of*.
* A user can only delete *their own* chat messages (if allowed).
* **Implementation**:
* Typically done within the service layer or controller *after* authentication and basic RBAC.
* The logic involves fetching the resource and comparing its owner ID (e.g., `resource.userId`) with the authenticated user's ID (`req.user.id`).
* **Example Logic (Conceptual)**:
```javascript
// In a service method for updating a user profile
async function updateUserProfile(userIdMakingRequest, targetUserId, updateData) {
  if (userIdMakingRequest !== targetUserId && req.user.role !== 'admin') { // Assuming req.user available
    throw new AuthorizationError('You are not authorized to update this profile.');
  }
  // Proceed with update
}
```
* **Interaction with RBAC**: Admins might be exempt from ownership checks for certain resources.
* **Maoga Context**: Critical for many user-specific actions like profile management, managing their matchmaking requests, lobby interactions, etc. This should be a standard check in relevant service methods.

## 5. Performance Optimization
### 5.1 Database Optimization
#### 5.1.1 Indexing Strategy
- Create indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use compound indexes for multi-field queries
- Add text indexes for search functionality
- Use TTL indexes for expiring data
- Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes

#### 5.1.2 Query Optimization
- Use projection to limit returned fields
- Limit results with pagination
- Use lean() for read-only queries
- Avoid deep nested populations
- Use aggregation for complex data transformations

#### 5.1.3 Connection Management
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Connection Management**:
* **MongoDB Connections (Mongoose)**:
* **Connection Pooling**: Mongoose manages a connection pool by default. When you call `mongoose.connect()`, it establishes a pool of connections that your application can use.
* **Configuration**: You can configure pool size (`poolSize` option in `mongoose.connect`) if needed, but the default is often fine for many applications. (Default is 5)
* **Singleton Connection**: Establish the MongoDB connection once when your application starts and reuse it throughout the application lifecycle. Don't connect/disconnect for every query.
* **Error Handling**: Handle initial connection errors and runtime connection issues (e.g., `disconnected`, `reconnected` events on the Mongoose connection object). Implement retry logic for initial connection if necessary.
* **Graceful Shutdown**: Close the MongoDB connection gracefully when your application shuts down (`mongoose.connection.close()`).
* **Redis Connections (if used)**:
* Similar principles: use a connection pool if the Redis client library supports it.
* Establish connection on app start, reuse it.
* Handle connection errors and implement graceful shutdown.
* **External API Connections (e.g., IGDB/RAWG)**:
* If using an SDK, it might manage connections or a client instance for you.
* Be mindful of rate limits and connection limits imposed by the external API.
* Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient network issues.
* Consider keep-alive for HTTP connections if making frequent calls.
* **Socket.IO Connections**: Managed by Socket.IO library. The main concern is scaling them across multiple server instances using an adapter like `socket.io-redis`.
* **Maoga Context**: For Mongoose, the default connection pooling is a good start. Ensure proper error handling and graceful shutdown. If Redis is added, apply similar principles.

### 5.2 Caching Strategy
#### 5.2.1 In-Memory Caching
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding In-Memory Caching**:
* **Purpose**: To store frequently accessed data directly in the memory of your Node.js application instance to reduce latency and load on backend services (like databases or external APIs).
* **Tools**: Libraries like `node-cache`, `memory-cache`, or even a simple JavaScript `Map` object if managing TTL and size manually.
* **Use Cases for Maoga**:
* Caching game details fetched from an external API (IGDB/RAWG) as planned in Sprint 3.
* Caching results of computationally intensive but stable calculations.
* Potentially caching some user preference data if it's very frequently read and rarely updated (though user data is often better cached in Redis for consistency across instances).
* **Pros**:
* Very fast access (no network latency).
* Simple to implement for single-instance deployments.
* **Cons**:
* **Not Shared**: Cache is local to each application instance. In a multi-instance (scaled) environment, this leads to inconsistent caches. User A might get a cached (stale) value from instance 1, while User B gets a fresh value from instance 2.
* **Memory Usage**: Consumes memory within your application process. Large caches can lead to high memory footprint.
* **No Persistence**: Cache is lost if the application instance restarts.
* **Cache Invalidation**: Critical. How do you update or remove stale data from the cache? (e.g., TTL-based expiry, event-driven invalidation).
* **Maoga Context**: Good for caching external API responses like game data, especially if these don't change very frequently. For a distributed setup (multiple server instances), in-memory caching is less suitable for data that needs to be consistent across all users/instances. Redis would be better for shared cache. Sprint 3 plans for in-memory `node-cache` or Redis. This is a good phased approach.
#### 5.2.2 Cache Middleware
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Cache Middleware**:
* **Purpose**: To create Express middleware that can automatically cache responses for certain API GET endpoints and serve subsequent requests from the cache, reducing load on your application logic and database.
* **How it Works**:
1.  Generates a cache key based on the request (e.g., URL, query parameters, relevant headers).
2.  Checks if a valid (non-expired) response exists in the cache (e.g., Redis, in-memory) for this key.
3.  If found, serves the cached response directly.
4.  If not found, proceeds to the route handler, and then caches the successful response before sending it to the client.
* **Tools**: Can be custom-built or use libraries (though specific Express middleware for this might vary in features). `apicache` is one such library.
* **Cache Store**: The middleware would need to integrate with a cache store (in-memory for single instance, Redis for distributed).
* **Configuration**:
* Which routes to cache.
* Cache duration (TTL) per route.
* Conditions for bypassing the cache (e.g., based on request headers).
* Cache key generation strategy.
* **Cache Invalidation**: This is the hardest part. How do you invalidate cached API responses when the underlying data changes (e.g., a game's details are updated)?
* Event-driven: When data is updated (e.g., `GameService.updateGame()`), explicitly invalidate related cache entries.
* TTL-based: Rely on cache entries expiring after a certain time (simpler, but can serve stale data for a period).
* **Maoga Context**: Could be useful for read-heavy, non-personalized GET endpoints like `/api/games` or `/api/games/{gameId}`. However, ensure a robust invalidation strategy. This is a more advanced optimization. (Not important until significant read load is observed on specific endpoints)


### 5.3 Response Optimization
#### 5.3.1 Compression
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Compression**:
* **Purpose**: To reduce the size of HTTP response bodies sent from your server to the client, leading to faster transfer times, reduced bandwidth usage, and improved perceived performance for users.
* **How it Works**: Uses algorithms like GZIP or Brotli to compress response data. Browsers that support these algorithms (most modern ones do) send an `Accept-Encoding` header (e.g., `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br`), and the server responds with compressed data and a `Content-Encoding` header.
* **Implementation in Express**: Use the `compression` middleware package.
```javascript
const compression = require('compression');
// ...
app.use(compression()); // Place early in the middleware stack
```
* **Configuration**: The `compression` middleware has options to:
* Set a `threshold` (don't compress responses smaller than this size, as compression overhead might outweigh benefits).
* Filter which requests to compress (e.g., based on content type). It typically compresses text-based formats like JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* **Benefits**: Significant for JSON APIs, especially those returning large payloads (e.g., lists of games, detailed user profiles).
* **Overhead**: Compression adds some CPU overhead on the server. However, for text-based data, the bandwidth savings and client-side performance improvement usually make it worthwhile. The `compression` middleware is optimized.
* **Maoga Context**: A simple and effective optimization. Should be implemented early on, as it's low effort for good gains.
#### 5.3.2 Pagination
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Pagination**:
* **Purpose**: To break down large sets of data (e.g., lists of users, games, chat messages, notifications) into smaller, manageable chunks (pages) for API responses. This prevents overwhelming the client, reduces server load, and improves API responsiveness.
* **Importance**: Essential for any endpoint that can return a potentially large list of items.
* **Common Pagination Strategies**:
1.  **Offset-based (or Page-based)**:
* Client sends `page` (e.g., 1) and `limit` (e.g., 20 items per page).
* Server calculates `skip = (page - 1) * limit` and uses `skip()` and `limit()` in database queries.
* **Pros**: Easy to implement, allows jumping to specific pages.
* **Cons**: Can have performance issues with large offsets in some databases (MongoDB generally handles this well with indexed sort fields, but can still be less efficient than cursor-based for very deep pagination). Can miss or duplicate items if data changes while paginating.
2.  **Cursor-based (or Keyset-based)**:
* Client sends `limit` and optionally a `cursor` (an opaque value, often the ID or a unique sorted field value of the last item seen on the previous page).
* Server queries for items "after" (or "before") the cursor, based on a consistent sort order.
* **Pros**: More performant for large datasets as it avoids large skips. More stable against data changing during pagination.
* **Cons**: More complex to implement. Doesn't easily allow jumping to arbitrary pages.
* **API Design**:
* Request: `GET /api/games?page=2&limit=20` or `GET /api/games?limit=20&cursor=someCursorValue`.
* Response: Include pagination metadata (as per `api-specs.md`):
```json
"meta": {
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "totalPages": 10, "totalItems": 200, "limit": 20, "nextCursor": "nextValue" } // Adapt based on strategy
}
```
* **Default Values**: Set default `limit` if not provided by the client (e.g., 20). Set a maximum allowed `limit` to prevent abuse (e.g., 100).
* **Maoga Context**: All list endpoints (games, users (admin), notifications, chat history, friend lists, etc.) need pagination. Start with offset/page-based as it's simpler and good enough for many cases. Consider cursor-based if performance issues arise with very large datasets or if real-time consistency during pagination is critical. `database-models.md` mentions both skip/limit and lastId (cursor).


## 6. Logging and Monitoring
### 6.1 Logging Strategy
#### 6.1.1 Logger Configuration
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Logger Configuration**:
* **Covered in `deployment-guide.md` (Section 7.1)**, but focusing here on the implementation details.
* **Library Choice**: Winston or Pino are good choices as planned in Sprint 1. Pino is generally known for higher performance.
* **Configuration Aspects**:
* **Log Level**: Dynamically configurable based on `NODE_ENV` (e.g., `debug` for development, `info` for production). This should come from an environment variable.
* **Format**:
* **JSON**: For production/staging, to integrate with log management systems. Include timestamp, level, message, and custom metadata (request ID, user ID).
* **Pretty Print/Console**: For development, a human-readable format (e.g., `pino-pretty` or Winston's `simple` or `colorize` format) is useful.
* **Transports (Winston specific)**: Define where logs go (e.g., Console, File, HTTP endpoint). For containerized apps, Console (stdout/stderr) is standard for production.
* **Metadata**:
* **Default Metadata**: Add common metadata to all log entries (e.g., service name: 'maoga-server', environment: `process.env.NODE_ENV`).
* **Request-Specific Metadata**: Use middleware or context (e.g., AsyncLocalStorage in Node.js) to inject request-specific data like trace IDs into logs without passing them through every function call.
* **Error Serialization**: Ensure errors are logged properly, including stack traces and any custom properties from `AppError` instances.
* **Singleton Instance**: Create and configure the logger instance once and export/import it where needed.
* **Example (Conceptual Pino)**:
```javascript
// utils/logger.js
const pino = require('pino');
const logger = pino({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  formatters: {
    level: (label) => { return { level: label }; } // Standardize level key
  },
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && {
    transport: {
      target: 'pino-pretty',
      options: { colorize: true }
    }
  })
});
module.exports = logger;
```
* **Maoga Context**: Sprint 1's plan for structured JSON logging with request tracer ID is spot on. Focus on making it easy to use throughout the codebase.
#### 6.1.2 Request Logging Middleware
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Request Logging Middleware**:
* **Purpose**: To automatically log details of every incoming HTTP request and its corresponding response. This is invaluable for debugging, auditing, and monitoring API traffic.
* **Tools**:
* **Morgan**: Popular HTTP request logger middleware for Express. Highly configurable.
* Custom middleware using your chosen logger (Winston/Pino).
* **Information to Log**:
* **Request**: HTTP method, URL (path and query), client IP address, `User-Agent` header, `Referer` header, request body (be cautious with sensitive data - potentially exclude or mask fields like passwords).
* **Response**: HTTP status code, response time (duration of request handling).
* Request ID/Trace ID (from previous middleware or generated here).
* Authenticated User ID (if available).
* **Format**: Log in a structured format (JSON) consistent with other application logs.
* **Placement**: Place early in the middleware stack to log as much as possible, but after any middleware that might add crucial context (like a request ID generator).
* **Example with Morgan (using JSON format)**:
```javascript
const morgan = require('morgan');
// Define a custom token for request ID if you have one
// morgan.token('id', req => req.id);
app.use(morgan('{"method":":method","url":":url","status":":status","res_time":":response-time ms","remote_addr":":remote-addr","user_agent":":user-agent"}'));
// For more complex JSON, you might need a custom function with morgan or use a different approach.
```
A common approach is to use Morgan with a stream that pipes to your main logger (Winston/Pino) to ensure consistent log format and destination.
* **Maoga Context**: Sprint 1 plans logging & monitoring with Morgan. This is a good choice. Ensure it integrates well with the structured logging setup (Winston/Pino).

### 6.2 Error Monitoring
#### 6.2.1 Uncaught Exception Handling
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Uncaught Exception Handling**:
* **Purpose**: To catch any synchronous errors that are not handled by `try...catch` blocks or an `asyncHandler` and thus would crash the Node.js process.
* **Node.js Event**: `process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => { ... });`
* **Best Practice**:
1.  **Log the error**: Log the error with full details (stack trace). This is critical for diagnosis.
2.  **Perform minimal synchronous cleanup**: If absolutely necessary (e.g., releasing a critical resource).
3.  **Exit gracefully**: `process.exit(1)`. It's generally considered unsafe to resume normal operation after an `uncaughtException` because the application's state might be corrupted.
4.  **Rely on a process manager** (like PM2, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes) to restart the application.
* **Why not resume?**: The error might have left the application in an inconsistent or unpredictable state. Continuing could lead to further errors or incorrect behavior.
* **Example**:
```javascript
// In server.js or app.js (top level)
process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {
  logger.fatal('UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION! Shutting down...', { errorName: error.name, errorMessage: error.message, stack: error.stack });
  // Perform any minimal synchronous cleanup if absolutely critical
  process.exit(1); // Exit and let orchestrator restart
});
```
* **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Similarly, handle unhandled promise rejections:
  `process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => { ... });`
  The behavior is often the same: log and exit.
* **Maoga Context**: This is a crucial safety net. Implement these handlers to ensure that if something unexpected goes terribly wrong, it's logged, and the application exits cleanly to be restarted by the environment.
#### 6.2.2 Health Check Endpoint
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Health Check Endpoint**:
* **Purpose**: A specific API endpoint (e.g., `/health`, `/status`) that monitoring systems, load balancers, and container orchestrators can periodically query to determine if the application instance is running and healthy.
* **Implementation**:
* A simple GET endpoint.
* Returns an HTTP `200 OK` status if healthy.
* Returns an HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` (or another 5xx) if unhealthy.
* **Levels of Health Checks**:
1.  **Basic Liveness**: Simply checks if the application process is running and responding to HTTP requests (e.g., returns `200 OK` with a simple message like `{ status: 'UP' }`).
2.  **Readiness/Deep Health Check**: Optionally, can perform more comprehensive checks:
* Verify connectivity to critical downstream services (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).
* Check internal application state (e.g., are critical components initialized?).
* *Caution*: Keep these checks fast and lightweight. Overly complex or slow health checks can cause their own problems.
* **Response Body**: Can include additional status information (e.g., uptime, status of dependencies), but the HTTP status code is the primary indicator.
* **Security**: Typically doesn't require authentication, but should not expose sensitive information.
* **Maoga Context**: Sprint 1 plans for a `/health` endpoint. This is essential for any automated deployment/orchestration (ECS, Kubernetes) as it's used for liveness and readiness probes. Start with a basic liveness check and expand to readiness if specific conditions for being "ready to serve traffic" are identified.

### 6.3 Metrics Collection
#### 6.3.1 Basic Metrics Middleware
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Basic Metrics Middleware**:
* **Purpose**: To collect and expose basic application-level metrics that can be scraped by a monitoring system like Prometheus or pushed to a service like StatsD/Datadog.
* **Metrics to Collect**:
* **HTTP Request Count**: Total number of requests, possibly broken down by method, path, and status code.
* **HTTP Request Duration**: Histogram or summary of request latencies, possibly by method and path.
* **Active Requests**: Number of requests currently being processed.
* **Node.js Process Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage (heapTotal, heapUsed, rss), event loop lag, active handles. (Libraries like `prom-client` can collect these automatically).
* **Tools**:
* `prom-client`: A Prometheus client library for Node.js. Allows you to define and expose metrics via an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`).
* `express-prom-bundle`: Middleware for Express that bundles several metrics (request count, latency) and exposes them for Prometheus.
* Custom middleware to increment counters or record timings.
* **Exposure**: Expose metrics on a dedicated endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`) that your monitoring system can scrape.
* **Maoga Context**: This is a step towards more detailed application monitoring. For the MVP, comprehensive logging and cloud provider metrics might be sufficient. Implementing this becomes more important as you adopt more sophisticated monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana or if you need custom business-level metrics exposed. (Not critical for MVP, but good for future scaling and operational insight)
#### 6.3.2 Metrics Route
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Metrics Route**:
* **Purpose**: An HTTP endpoint (commonly `/metrics`) where the application exposes its collected metrics in a format consumable by monitoring systems, particularly Prometheus.
* **Format**: If using Prometheus, the metrics are exposed in a simple text-based format.
```
# HELP http_requests_total Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{method="GET",route="/api/users",status_code="200"} 1027
http_requests_total{method="POST",route="/api/users",status_code="201"} 120
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds Duration of HTTP requests in seconds.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_bucket{le="0.1",method="GET",route="/api/users"} 500
...
```
* **Implementation**:
* If using `prom-client`, it provides a method to get the metrics string:
```javascript
const client = require('prom-client');
// ... define metrics ...
app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', client.register.contentType);
  res.end(await client.register.metrics());
});
```
* **Security**: The `/metrics` endpoint should typically be firewalled or access-controlled so that only your monitoring system can scrape it. It can expose information about application internals and traffic patterns.
* **Maoga Context**: Directly related to "Basic Metrics Middleware". If you implement metrics collection (e.g., with `prom-client`), this is how you expose them. (Not critical for MVP unless setting up Prometheus early)


## 7. Deployment and Operations
### 7.1 Environment Configuration
#### 7.1.1 Environment Variables
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Environment Variables**:
* **Purpose**: To configure your application differently across various environments (development, test, staging, production) without changing code. Used for settings like database connection strings, API keys, port numbers, log levels, JWT secrets, etc.
* **How Node.js Accesses Them**: `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.
* **Loading `.env` files (for local development)**:
* Use a library like `dotenv` to load variables from a `.env` file into `process.env` at the start of your application.
* The `.env` file should be in your project root and **gitignored**.
* Maintain an `.env.example` file (committed to Git) that lists all required environment variables with placeholder or example values.
* **Production/Staging Environments**:
* Environment variables are typically injected by the hosting platform (e.g., ECS Task Definition, Kubernetes Pod spec, Heroku config vars).
* These values can come from secure stores like AWS Parameter Store, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets.
* **Never hardcode secrets or environment-specific configurations in your codebase.**
* **Required Variables for Maoga**:
* `NODE_ENV` (development, production, test)
* `PORT`
* `MONGODB_URI`
* `JWT_SECRET`
* `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`
* `EXTERNAL_GAME_API_KEY` (for IGDB/RAWG)
* `LOG_LEVEL`
* `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated list)
* `REDIS_URL` (if Redis is used)
* `FCM_SERVER_KEY` (for push notifications, Sprint 8)
* Cloud storage credentials (Sprint 11)
* Payment provider keys (Sprint 14)
* **Validation/Defaults**: Optionally, have a config module that reads environment variables, validates them (e.g., checks if required ones are set), and provides default values for some.
* **Maoga Context**: Fundamental for configuration. Sprint 1 plans for `.env` and secret management.
#### 7.1.2 Environment-Specific Configurations
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Environment-Specific Configurations**:
* **Purpose**: To manage settings that vary between `development`, `test`, `staging`, and `production` environments beyond just what's in environment variables (though env vars are the primary mechanism).
* **How it's often done**:
1.  **Environment Variables (Primary)**: Most configuration should be driven by environment variables as discussed above.
2.  **Configuration Files (Less common for secrets, good for complex non-secret structures)**:
* A `config` directory with files like `default.json`, `development.json`, `production.json`.
* Libraries like `config` (npm package) can load and merge these based on `NODE_ENV`.
* `default.json` contains base settings.
* `development.json` overrides for development, etc.
* Environment variables can override values from these files.
* **Secrets should still not be in these committed files; they should be injected via environment variables that the config files might reference.**
* **Examples of what might differ beyond secrets**:
* Log levels (already covered by env var `LOG_LEVEL`).
* External API URLs (e.g., pointing to a sandbox version of an external API in dev/staging).
* Feature flags (if you have a more complex system than simple env vars).
* Caching behavior (e.g., shorter TTLs or disabled cache in dev).
* Resource limits or pool sizes (though often better in deployment descriptors).
* **Maoga Project Structure**: Your `src/config/environments/` directory suggests you are planning for this file-based approach in conjunction with environment variables. This is a good pattern.
```javascript
// src/config/index.js (conceptual)
const _ = require('lodash');
const defaultConfig = require('./default');
const envConfig = require(`./environments/${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}`);
module.exports = _.merge({}, defaultConfig, envConfig); // envConfig overrides defaultConfig
// This module would then read process.env for secrets or critical overrides.
```
* **Maoga Context**: The planned structure with `src/config/environments/` is suitable. Prioritize environment variables for anything sensitive or frequently changed. Use config files for more stable, structured, non-secret configurations that differ per environment.

### 7.2 Docker Configuration
#### 7.2.1 Dockerfile
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Dockerfile**:
* **Covered in `deployment-guide.md` (Sections 3.1 for Dev, 3.2 for Prod)**.
* **Key Principles for Implementation Guidelines**:
* **Multi-stage builds for production**: Reduces image size and attack surface.
* **Specific Node.js version**: Use a specific version (e.g., `node:18.17.0-alpine`) rather than just `node:alpine` for reproducibility.
* **Cache `npm install`**: Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, install, then copy application code.
* **Non-root user**: Run the application as a non-root user.
* **`.dockerignore`**: Use effectively.
* **`HEALTHCHECK` instruction** for production images.
* **Graceful shutdown handling** in your Node.js app (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`).
* **Environment variables**: Don't bake secrets into the image. Use `ENV` for defaults, rely on runtime injection.
* **Working directory**: Set a `WORKDIR`.
* **Expose port**: `EXPOSE <port>`.
* **Command**: `CMD ["node", "src/server.js"]` or `CMD ["npm", "start"]`.
* **Maoga Context**: The `deployment-guide.md` covers this well. Reiterate the importance of multi-stage builds for production here.
#### 7.2.2 Docker Compose
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Docker Compose**:
* **Covered in `deployment-guide.md` (Sections 2.5 for Dev, 5.2 for Staging)**.
* **Key Principles for Implementation Guidelines**:
* **Development**:
* Define services for app, DB (MongoDB), cache (Redis if used).
* Use volumes for code (hot reloading) and DB data persistence.
* Manage environment variables via `.env` files.
* Simplify local development setup (`docker-compose up`).
* **Staging (if used on a single host)**:
* Use production-like images.
* Connect to staging external services (e.g., MongoDB Atlas staging cluster).
* Manage staging configurations.
* Recognize limitations compared to orchestrators for a "true" staging environment.
* **Production**: Docker Compose is generally **not recommended for production deployments** of scalable, highly available applications. Use ECS, Kubernetes, or similar orchestrators.
* **Maoga Context**: Excellent for local development. For staging, it's a maybe, but prefer ECS/Kubernetes if those are the production targets. Not for production.


### 7.3 CI/CD Configuration
#### 7.3.1 GitHub Actions Workflow
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding GitHub Actions Workflow**:
* **Covered in `deployment-guide.md` (Section 4.1)**.
* **Key Steps in Workflow for Implementation Guidelines**:
1.  **Checkout code**.
2.  **Set up Node.js environment**.
3.  **Cache dependencies** (`node_modules`).
4.  **Install dependencies** (`npm ci` - preferred for CI as it uses `package-lock.json`).
5.  **Linting and Formatting checks**.
6.  **Run tests** (unit, integration). This might involve starting up a MongoDB instance (e.g., using `services` in GitHub Actions).
7.  **Build application** (if there's a build step, e.g., TypeScript).
8.  **(Optional) Build Docker image**.
9.  **(Optional) Push Docker image to registry** (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
10. **(Optional) Deploy** to staging or production (can be a separate workflow).
11. **(Optional) Security Scans** (`npm audit`, image scan).
* **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data needed in the workflow (e.g., API keys for deployment, registry credentials).
* **Triggers**: On push/pull_request to `main`/`develop`.
* **Maoga Context**: Sprint 1 plans for CI/CD with GitHub Actions. This is standard and good.

### 7.4 Backup and Disaster Recovery
#### 7.4.1 MongoDB Backup Script
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding MongoDB Backup Script**:
* **MongoDB Atlas**: If using MongoDB Atlas (planned for staging/production), it provides automated, continuous backups and point-in-time recovery. **A custom backup script for Atlas is generally not needed and not recommended**, as Atlas's native backups are more robust and integrated.
* **When a script might be considered (and why it's usually not the best for prod)**:
* **Self-hosted MongoDB**: If you were self-hosting MongoDB (e.g., on an EC2 instance or local server), you would need a script.
* **Local Development "Backups"**: For a developer's local machine, if they want to snapshot their local DB, they could use `mongodump`. But this isn't for disaster recovery of the main app.
* **Specific Data Export Needs**: If you need to export a subset of data in a specific format for archival or transfer, a script using `mongoexport` might be used, but this is different from a full disaster recovery backup.
* **If a script were needed (for self-hosted)**:
* Use `mongodump` utility.
* Schedule with `cron` or Task Scheduler.
* Specify database, output directory.
* Options for compression (`--gzip`).
* Store backups securely (off-server, encrypted).
* Include date/timestamps in backup filenames.
* Implement retention policies (e.g., delete backups older than X days).
* **Maoga Context**: **Focus on leveraging MongoDB Atlas backups for production/staging.** A custom script is unnecessary overhead and likely less reliable than the managed service offering. (Not important if using MongoDB Atlas as planned)
#### 7.4.2 Restore Script
**Thoughts/Considerations regarding Restore Script**:
* **MongoDB Atlas**: Restoration is typically done through the MongoDB Atlas UI or API. It allows for point-in-time recovery to a new cluster or by overwriting an existing one (with caution). **A custom restore script for Atlas is generally not needed.**
* **When a script might be considered (for self-hosted)**:
* If you have backups created by `mongodump`, you'd use `mongorestore` to restore them.
* A script could automate the process:
* Fetching the desired backup file (e.g., from S3).
* Decompressing if needed.
* Running `mongorestore` with appropriate options (host, port, db, drop existing collections if needed).
* **Testing Restores**: The most critical part of any backup strategy is *testing the restore process regularly* to ensure backups are valid and the restore procedure works as expected. This applies even with Atlas – you should know how to perform a restore.
* **Maoga Context**: For production/staging using Atlas, familiarize yourself with the Atlas restore process. No custom script is needed. Document the Atlas restore procedure as part of your disaster recovery plan. (Not important if using MongoDB Atlas as planned for restore operations)
